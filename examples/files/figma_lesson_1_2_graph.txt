Principles
Foundations
Accessibility
Color systems
Typography
Type scale
Elevation
Icon systems
Grids
Layouts
Spacing
Patterns
Documentation
Naming systems
Processes
Designer-developer collaboration
Relationships:

Principles are the guiding standards and approaches of a design system
Principles reflect the company's beliefs and values
Foundations are the building blocks of a design system
Foundations include visual styles, colors, typography, components, patterns, structures, behaviors, and conventions
Accessibility is an important practice to include in design system foundations
Color systems provide semantic meaning for functions like messaging, status, priority, and actions
Typography systems create consistency, personality, and readability across a product
Type scales are collections of font sizes and styles that make up a type system
Elevation provides hierarchy, separation, and visual feedback in design systems
Icon systems are collections of icons used throughout a product or brand
Grids, layouts, and spacing provide structure and rhythm to designs
Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems or user goals in a product
Documentation communicates the purpose and application of design system elements
Naming systems make it easier to find, understand, and apply elements in a design system
Processes capture the mechanics and governance for managing a design system
Designer-developer collaboration influences the success of a design system and product development process
