Relationships:

Design systems provide tools and resources to build consistent and cohesive products.
Design systems include style guides, component libraries, and pattern libraries.
Design systems focus on the entire product ecosystem, not just UI elements.
Figma is a tool used to build design systems.
Principles are the guiding standards and approaches of a design system.
Foundations are the building blocks of a design system.
Accessibility is an important practice to include in design system foundations.
Color systems provide semantic meaning for functions.
Typography systems create consistency, personality, and readability.
Type scales are collections of font sizes and styles that make up a type system.
Elevation provides hierarchy, separation, and visual feedback.
Icon systems are collections of icons used throughout a product or brand.
Grids, layouts, and spacing provide structure and rhythm to designs.
Components are the building blocks of designs in a design system.
Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems or user goals.
Documentation communicates how to use the design system.
Naming conventions ensure consistency between design and code.
Libraries are collections of styles and components shared within a team.
Processes capture the mechanics and governance for managing a design system.
Designer-developer collaboration influences the success of a design system.
Style guides define the appearance and voice/tone of elements.
Audits help take stock of the product and identify areas of improvement.
Contributors are people who help build and maintain the design system.
The audience of a design system includes designers, developers, and other teams.
Testing validates the design system.
User interviews gather feedback.
Tasks evaluate system usage.
Feedback channels enable ongoing input.
Contribution process enables system improvements.
Internal process is intended for system maintainers.
External process is intended for system users.
Changelogs track system updates.
Version numbers identify system iterations.
Semantic versioning follows the Major.Minor.Patch pattern.
Branching allows isolated development.
Merging integrates changes.
Advocacy promotes system adoption.
