Key Concepts:
- Design systems
- Figma
- Styles
- Components
- Libraries
- Atomic design
- Naming conventions
- Layout grids
- Auto layout
- Color styles
- Text styles
- Elevation
- Icons
- Illustrations
- Component properties
- Variants
- Patterns
- Documentation
- Maintenance

Relationships:
- Figma is a tool used to build design systems
- Styles allow reuse of properties and settings in Figma
- Components are the building blocks of designs in a design system
- Libraries are collections of styles and components shared within a team or organization
- Atomic design is a modular approach to building components
- Naming conventions ensure consistency between design and code
- Layout grids help enforce spacing and sizing consistency
- Auto layout maintains consistent spacing and layout as a frame's content changes
- Color styles define and organize colors used in a design system
- Text styles define typography properties like font family, weight, size, line-height, and letter spacing
- Elevation establishes hierarchy, creates separation, and communicates interaction
- Icons and illustrations support brand personality and require consistent sizing and naming
- Component properties allow customization of components
- Variants represent different states or versions of a component
- Patterns are fixed combinations of components for specific use cases
- Documentation communicates how to use the design system
- Maintenance processes keep the design system updated over time
