Relationships:

Design systems provide tools and resources to build consistent and cohesive products
Design systems include style guides, component libraries, and pattern libraries
Design systems focus on the entire product ecosystem, not just UI elements
Style guides define the appearance and voice/tone of elements
Component libraries contain the building blocks of a product
Component libraries include individual components, layouts, templates, and interaction patterns
Component libraries often include redlines, annotations, or code components with documentation
Design systems can improve consistency, efficiency, usability, and accessibility
Audits help take stock of the entire product and identify areas of improvement
Audits involve identifying user flows and all elements used in the product
Audits require collaboration with cross-functional partners
Contributors are people who help build and maintain the design system
The audience of a design system includes designers, developers, UX writers, and other teams
Design systems can be built from the ground up, use parts of existing systems, or a combination of approaches
