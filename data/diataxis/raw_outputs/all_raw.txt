Explanation and reference:

Q1: What is the main difference between explanation and reference in the context of the Diátaxis framework?
A1: The main difference between explanation and reference is that explanation is focused on the acquisition of skill and knowledge (study), while reference is concerned with the application of that skill and knowledge (work).

Q2: How do explanation and reference relate to the overall structure of the Diátaxis map?
A2: Explanation and reference both belong to the theory half of the Diátaxis map, as they contain theoretical knowledge rather than steps to guide the reader. However, they serve different purposes within that theoretical realm, with explanation supporting learning and reference supporting doing.

Q3: Why is it important to distinguish between explanation and reference when creating documentation?
A3: Distinguishing between explanation and reference is important because they serve different user needs and require different approaches to content creation. Mixing the two can lead to less effective documentation that fails to fully support either the acquisition or application of knowledge and skills.

A straightforward distinction, mostly:

Q1: What are some examples of writing that are clearly either explanation or reference?
A1: A tidal chart with tables of figures is a clear example of reference material, while an article that explains why there are tides and how they behave is self-evidently explanation.

Q2: What are some good rules of thumb for distinguishing between explanation and reference?
A2: Some good rules of thumb for distinguishing between explanation and reference are that reference material is often boring and unmemorable, consists of lists of things (such as classes, methods, or attributes) and tables of information. Explanation, on the other hand, is more engaging and can be imagined being read in a relaxed setting or discussed with a friend.

Q3: How can the question "Can you tell me more about...?" help to identify whether a piece of content is likely to be explanation or reference?
A3: If you can imagine asking a friend, "Can you tell me more about...?" and the answer or discussion that follows is likely to provide context, background, and deeper understanding of a topic, then the content is most likely explanation. Reference material, in contrast, would provide a more structured, factual response without the same level of elaboration.

... but intuition isn't reliable enough:

Q1: What is a common pitfall when writing reference material that can lead to the inclusion of explanatory content?
A1: A common pitfall when writing reference material is the temptation to develop illustrative examples into more expansive explanations, using them to explore the "why," "what if," or "how it came to be" aspects of a topic. This can result in reference material being interrupted and obscured by digressions.

Q2: Why is it problematic to mix explanatory content into reference material, and vice versa?
A2: Mixing explanatory content into reference material is problematic because it interrupts and obscures the reference, making it harder for users to find the factual information they need. Similarly, including reference-style content in explanation can prevent the explanation from developing properly and fulfilling its purpose of providing deeper understanding and context.

Q3: How can being aware of the potential to slip between explanation and reference help documentation authors create more effective content?
A3: By being aware of the potential to slip between explanation and reference, documentation authors can be more intentional about keeping each type of content focused on its specific purpose. This allows reference material to remain concise and factual, while enabling explanation to fully explore and contextualize a topic, ultimately leading to more effective documentation that better serves users' needs.

Work and study:

Q1: What is the key question to ask when determining whether a piece of content should be classified as reference or explanation?
A1: The key question to ask when determining whether a piece of content should be classified as reference or explanation is: "Is this something someone would turn to while working and actively getting something done, or is it something they would need when they have stepped away from the work and want to think about it more deeply?"

Q2: How does the distinction between work and study reflect the reader's relationship to the craft or topic being documented?
A2: The distinction between work and study reflects the reader's relationship to the craft or topic at a particular moment. When working, the reader is actively engaged in applying their knowledge and skills to complete a task. When studying, the reader is focused on acquiring new knowledge and skills or deepening their understanding of a topic.

Q3: Why is understanding the distinction between work and study crucial for creating effective reference and explanation content?
A3: Understanding the distinction between work and study is crucial for creating effective reference and explanation content because it helps documentation authors tailor their content to the specific needs of users at different points in their engagement with a topic. By providing the right type of content for each context, authors can better support users in both the acquisition and application of knowledge and skills.

The compass:

Q1: What is the purpose of "The compass" in the context of distinguishing between reference and explanation content?
A1: "The compass" is a tool or framework mentioned in the text that can help documentation authors avoid being misled by intuition when deciding whether a piece of content should be classified as reference or explanation.

Q2: How can documentation authors use "The compass" to ensure they are creating content that effectively meets users' needs?
A2: By referring to "The compass," documentation authors can more objectively assess whether a piece of content aligns with the needs of users who are actively working and applying knowledge (reference) or those who are studying and acquiring knowledge (explanation). This helps them create content that is more closely tailored to the specific context and needs of each user group.

Q3: What are the key characteristics of reference and explanation content, according to the summary provided at the end of the document?
A3: According to the summary, reference content is what a user needs to help them apply knowledge and skill while they are actively working, while explanation content is what someone will turn to when they want to acquire knowledge and skill through study. Understanding and responding to these distinct needs is key to creating effective reference and explanation content.The basics:

Q1: How can the application of Diátaxis be described for most documentation projects, and what factors contribute to its straightforward implementation?
A1: The application of Diátaxis to most documentation projects can be described as fairly straightforward, largely due to the clear boundaries of the product defining the domain of concern and the ease of arranging contents according to the principles of tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation.

Q2: What role do landing pages play in the basic structure of documentation organized according to Diátaxis principles?
A2: Landing pages play a crucial role in the basic structure of documentation organized according to Diátaxis principles, serving as overview pages that provide context for the content within each section, such as describing what a tutorial has to offer or introducing the available how-to guides.

Q3: How can the basic structure of Diátaxis be effectively applied to large documentation sets, and what considerations should be made as the size of the documentation grows?
A3: The basic structure of Diátaxis can be effectively applied to large documentation sets by maintaining the clear division into tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation. However, as the size of the documentation grows, it may be necessary to introduce grouping of pages within sections to maintain organization and ease of navigation.

Adding a layer of hierarchy:

Q1: How can additional layers of hierarchy be used to address specific needs within a documentation section, and what is an example of this in practice?
A1: Additional layers of hierarchy can be used to address specific needs within a documentation section by creating sub-sections that focus on particular aspects of the topic. For example, within the "how-to guides" section, a sub-section could be created to address different installation options, such as local installation, Docker, virtual machines, and Linux containers.

Q2: What is the purpose of having an overview landing page at each level of the hierarchy within a documentation section?
A2: The purpose of having an overview landing page at each level of the hierarchy within a documentation section is to provide orientation for the reader, introducing the content that follows and helping them navigate the structure of the documentation.

Q3: How does the addition of layers of hierarchy in documentation organized according to Diátaxis principles help to maintain the effectiveness of the system, even for very large documentation sets?
A3: The addition of layers of hierarchy in documentation organized according to Diátaxis principles helps to maintain the effectiveness of the system by breaking down large sections into more manageable sub-sections, each with its own clear focus and purpose. This allows the documentation to scale while still adhering to the principles of separating content by user needs and goals.

The problem of lists:

Q1: What is the maximum comfortable length for lists in documentation, and why is it important to adhere to this limit?
A1: The maximum comfortable length for lists in documentation is generally considered to be seven items, as lists longer than this become very hard for humans to read unless they have an inherent mechanical order, such as numerical or alphabetical.

Q2: What should documentation authors do if they find themselves with lists that exceed the comfortable length limit in their tables of contents?
A2: If documentation authors find themselves with lists that exceed the comfortable length limit in their tables of contents, they should seek ways to break the lists up into smaller ones, prioritizing the reader's experience over the integrity of any particular organizational scheme.

Q3: How does the principle of fitting user needs, which underlies Diátaxis, relate to the problem of long lists in documentation?
A3: The principle of fitting user needs, which underlies Diátaxis, suggests that if the execution of Diátaxis leads to formats that seem uncomfortable or ugly, such as long lists, then the documentation author needs to use the system differently to prioritize the reader's experience. Diátaxis works because it aligns with user needs, and this should be the primary consideration when organizing documentation.

Overviews and introductory text:

Q1: What should the content of a landing page in documentation organized according to Diátaxis principles read like, and why is this important?
A1: The content of a landing page in documentation organized according to Diátaxis principles should read like an overview, introducing the content that follows rather than simply presenting lists of other content. This is important because it helps to orient the reader and provide context for the information they are about to encounter.

Q2: How can elements like headings and snippets of introductory text enhance the reader's experience on a landing page, and what is an example of this in practice?
A2: Elements like headings and snippets of introductory text can enhance the reader's experience on a landing page by catching their eye and providing context for the content that follows. For example, a how-to guide landing page might include a brief description of the types of guides available, such as installation guides and deployment and scaling guides, with short introductions to each category.

Q3: Why is it important for documentation authors to remember that they are writing for human users, rather than simply fulfilling the demands of an organizational scheme like Diátaxis?
A3: It is important for documentation authors to remember that they are writing for human users, rather than simply fulfilling the demands of an organizational scheme like Diátaxis, because the ultimate goal of documentation is to meet the needs of the reader. While Diátaxis provides a valuable framework for organizing content, the reader's experience should always be the top priority, and authors should be willing to adapt their approach as needed to ensure that the documentation is accessible, engaging, and informative.

Two-dimensional problems:

Q1: What is an example of a "two-dimensional problem" that can arise when applying Diátaxis to documentation, and how does this challenge the straightforward implementation of the system?
A1: An example of a "two-dimensional problem" that can arise when applying Diátaxis to documentation is when the structure outlined by Diátaxis intersects with another structure, such as topic areas within the documentation or very different user types. This can challenge the straightforward implementation of the system by introducing competing organizational priorities and requiring a more nuanced approach to structuring the content.

Q2: How might the presence of different user types, such as users, developers, and contributors, impact the organization of documentation according to Diátaxis principles?
A2: The presence of different user types, such as users, developers, and contributors, might impact the organization of documentation according to Diátaxis principles by requiring the documentation to address very different concerns for each audience. This could lead to the creation of separate sections for each user type, each with its own set of tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation, or to a more complex structure that allows for shared content while still addressing the specific needs of each audience.

Q3: What are some of the factors that can contribute to the need for a more complex documentation structure, even when applying Diátaxis principles?
A3: Some of the factors that can contribute to the need for a more complex documentation structure, even when applying Diátaxis principles, include the presence of distinct use cases for the same product (such as use on land, sea, and air), the need to address the requirements of different user types (such as users, developers, and contributors), and the impact of external factors on the product's implementation (such as deployment on different public clouds with varying workflows and constraints).

What is the problem?:

Q1: Is the problem of managing complex documentation structures unique to Diátaxis, or is it a more general challenge in documentation design?
A1: The problem of managing complex documentation structures is not unique to Diátaxis but is a general challenge in documentation design. However, Diátaxis can help to reveal the problem by bringing it into focus and demanding that it be addressed as part of the documentation organization process.

Q2: What is a common misunderstanding about Diátaxis that can lead to confusion when dealing with complex documentation structures?
A2: A common misunderstanding about Diátaxis is that it is a rigid scheme into which documentation must be placed, with four distinct boxes corresponding to tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation. In reality, Diátaxis posits four different kinds of documentation around which content should be structured, but this does not necessarily mean that there must be only four divisions in the documentation hierarchy.

Q3: How can the recognition that Diátaxis is not a rigid, four-box structure help documentation authors to approach the challenge of organizing complex content?
A3: The recognition that Diátaxis is not a rigid, four-box structure can help documentation authors to approach the challenge of organizing complex content by encouraging them to focus on the underlying principles of the system, such as addressing different user needs and structuring content accordingly, rather than feeling constrained by a particular format. This can lead to more flexible and effective documentation structures that still adhere to the core ideas of Diátaxis.

Diátaxis as an approach:

Q1: How should Diátaxis be understood, if not as a simple diagram or set of boxes into which content must be placed?
A1: Diátaxis should be understood as an approach or way of working with documentation that identifies four different user needs (learning, doing, information, and understanding) and uses them to guide the authoring and structuring of content. While this approach often leads to a clear division of content into tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation, this structure is an outcome of the underlying principles, not the end goal in itself.

Q2: What is the relationship between the four categories of documentation identified by Diátaxis and the overall structure of a documentation set?
A2: The four categories of documentation identified by Diátaxis (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation) serve as the basis around which documentation should be structured, but they do not necessarily dictate a strict, four-part hierarchy. The structure of the documentation should emerge from the application of Diátaxis principles to the specific needs of the product, its users, and the content itself.

Q3: How can focusing on the underlying principles of Diátaxis, rather than a particular structural template, help documentation authors to create more effective and user-friendly content?
A3: Focusing on the underlying principles of Diátaxis, such as identifying and addressing different user needs, can help documentation authors to create more effective and user-friendly content by ensuring that the structure and organization of the documentation emerge from a deep understanding of the audience and their goals. This approach allows for greater flexibility in the face of complex content and unique product requirements while still maintaining the benefits of a structured, purposeful documentation system.

User-first thinking:

Q1: What is the key principle that underpins Diátaxis, and how should this guide documentation authors in their approach to organizing content?
A1: The key principle that underpins Diátaxis is attention to user needs, and this should guide documentation authors in their approach to organizing content by focusing on the product as it is experienced and understood by the user, rather than as it is conceived by its creators.

Q2: How can documentation authors determine whether a product with multiple use cases (such as use on land, sea, and air) should be treated as a single entity or as separate products for the purposes of documentation?
A2: Documentation authors can determine whether a product with multiple use cases should be treated as a single entity or as separate products for the purposes of documentation by considering how the users themselves perceive and interact with the product. If the use cases are so distinct that they effectively constitute different products in the minds of the users, then it may be appropriate to structure the documentation accordingly, with separate sections or even separate documentation sets for each use case.

Q3: How might documentation authors approach the challenge of organizing content for a product with diverse user types, such as users, developers, and contributors?
A3: When organizing content for a product with diverse user types, such as users, developers, and contributors, documentation authors should consider the relationships between these user types and the extent to which their needs overlap or diverge. For example, if developers typically need to understand how the product is used in order to build effectively with it, then it may make sense to structure the documentation in a way that allows developer-focused content to build upon user-focused content in some areas (such as tutorials), while keeping other areas (such as how-to guides) separate and targeted to each audience's specific needs.

Let documentation be complex if necessary:

Q1: What is the key consideration when determining how complex a documentation structure should be, and why is it important to allow for complexity when necessary?
A1: The key consideration when determining how complex a documentation structure should be is the needs of the users and the requirements of the content itself. It is important to allow for complexity when necessary because oversimplifying the documentation structure in the name of adherence to a particular system or template can ultimately make the content less accessible and useful to its intended audience.

Q2: How can documentation authors balance the need for complexity in documentation structure with the goal of making the content easy to navigate and use?
A2: Documentation authors can balance the need for complexity in documentation structure with the goal of making the content easy to navigate and use by ensuring that the structure, however complex, is logical and incorporates patterns that align with the needs and expectations of the users. This may involve the use of clear navigation elements, consistent labeling and organization, and appropriate use of cross-referencing and linking between related content areas.

Q3: What is the relationship between the complexity of a documentation structure and the underlying principles of Diátaxis?
A3: The relationship between the complexity of a documentation structure and the underlying principles of Diátaxis is one of flexibility and adaptation. While Diátaxis provides a valuable framework for organizing documentation around user needs and goals, it is not a rigid template that must be followed at the expense of clarity, usability, and appropriateness to the content and audience. A complex documentation structure that emerges from a thoughtful application of Diátaxis principles and a deep understanding of user needs is ultimately more effective than a simpler structure that fails to address the unique requirements of the product and its users.About explanation:

Q1: What is the main focus of explanation in documentation, and how does it differ from tutorials, how-to guides, and reference material?
A1: Explanation focuses on clarifying, deepening, and broadening the reader's understanding of a subject, approaching it from a higher perspective and different angles. It is not directly concerned with the user's actions or the close-up view of the machinery, unlike tutorials, how-to guides, and reference material.

Q2: How does the format of explanation allow for a different style of considering a topic compared to other forms of documentation?
A2: The format of explanation allows for a more relaxed, freer way of considering a topic, as it is not tied to the user's immediate actions or the specifics of the machinery. This enables explanation to become a discussion, joining things together and making sense to read while away from the product itself.

Q3: What is the key characteristic of explanation that distinguishes it from the other three forms of documentation?
A3: The key characteristic of explanation is that it is understanding-oriented, focusing on clarifying and illuminating a particular topic rather than directly guiding the user's practice or work, setting it apart from tutorials, how-to guides, and reference material.

The value and place of explanation:

Q1: Why is explanation sometimes mistakenly seen as being of lesser importance compared to other forms of documentation?
A1: Explanation is sometimes mistakenly seen as less important because it doesn't have a direct part in a user's immediate practice or work, unlike tutorials, how-to guides, and reference material. However, this perception is flawed, as explanation plays a crucial role in helping practitioners understand their craft and weave together their knowledge.

Q2: What is the significance of the connection between words meaning "understanding" and words meaning "to hold or grasp" in many European languages?
A2: The connection between words meaning "understanding" and words meaning "to hold or grasp" in many European languages highlights the importance of being able to possess and internalize knowledge. Explanation helps seal together the components of a practitioner's mastery of a craft, making it their own and ensuring that their knowledge is not loose, fragmented, or fragile.

Q3: What are some alternative names for the "Explanation" section in documentation, and what do they suggest about the nature of this type of content?
A3: Alternative names for the "Explanation" section include "Discussion," "Background," "Conceptual guides," and "Topics." These names suggest that explanation is a form of discourse that provides context, explores concepts, and delves into the underlying ideas and principles of a subject, rather than focusing on practical instructions or reference details.

Explanation and its boundaries:

Q1: Why is explanation often scattered in small parcels across other sections of documentation instead of being given its own dedicated section?
A1: Explanation is often scattered across other sections of documentation because it can be challenging to write good explanatory material, and its open-ended nature can give writers too many possibilities. Without a clear starting point or conclusion, it is easier to include explanation in small doses within other, more well-defined sections.

Q2: What can serve as a useful prompt for writing explanatory content, helping to define its scope and boundaries?
A2: A real or imagined "why" question can serve as a useful prompt for writing explanatory content, providing a focus and helping to define the scope and boundaries of the material. In the absence of such a question, the writer must draw reasonable lines to mark out the area they will cover in their explanation.

Q3: How do tutorials, how-to guides, and reference material differ from explanation in terms of the clarity of their scope and boundaries?
A3: Tutorials, how-to guides, and reference material have a more clearly defined scope compared to explanation, as they are bounded by specific user needs, tasks, or the scope of the machinery itself. Explanation, on the other hand, has a more open-ended nature, requiring the writer to make conscious decisions about the boundaries of their discussion.

Analogy from cooking:

Q1: How does Harold McGee's book "On Food and Cooking" exemplify the role of explanation in the context of a craft?
A1: "On Food and Cooking" exemplifies the role of explanation by placing food and cooking in the context of history, society, science, and technology, without providing recipes or instructions. It changes the reader's understanding and thinking about the craft of cooking, even if it doesn't directly alter their practical actions in the kitchen.

Q2: What is the key difference between a book like "On Food and Cooking" and a cookbook or a reference guide about cooking?
A2: The key difference is that "On Food and Cooking" focuses on deepening the reader's understanding and knowledge of the subject, exploring it from multiple perspectives, while a cookbook provides practical recipes and a reference guide offers specific technical information. It is a work of explanation rather than instruction or reference.

Q3: When and how might someone engage with a work of explanation like "On Food and Cooking," and how does this differ from their use of instructional or reference material?
A3: Someone might read a work of explanation like "On Food and Cooking" at their leisure, away from the immediate context of the kitchen, when they want to think about cooking at a higher level and understand more about the subject. This differs from their use of instructional or reference material, which they would consult while actively engaged in the practice of cooking or seeking specific information.

Writing good explanation:

Q1: How does the concept of weaving a web of understanding relate to the goal of making connections when writing explanation?
A1: The concept of weaving a web of understanding relates to the goal of making connections in explanation by emphasizing the importance of linking ideas, concepts, and even seemingly unrelated topics to create a rich, interconnected knowledge base for the reader. By making these connections, the writer helps the reader develop a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject.

Q2: What are some examples of the types of context and background information that can be included in explanation to help readers understand why things are the way they are?
A2: Examples of context and background information that can be included in explanation are design decisions, historical reasons, technical constraints, implications, and specific examples. These elements help readers understand the factors that have shaped the current state of the subject and provide a foundation for grasping its underlying principles and reasoning.

Q3: How does thinking of explanation as a discussion help writers approach the inclusion of alternatives, counter-examples, and contrary opinions?
A3: Thinking of explanation as a discussion helps writers approach the inclusion of alternatives, counter-examples, and contrary opinions by encouraging them to consider the subject from multiple angles and present a balanced, nuanced view. By weighing up different perspectives and acknowledging valid alternatives, writers can create a more engaging and thought-provoking explanation that invites readers to think critically about the topic.

Don't instruct, or provide technical reference:

Q1: What is the main risk of allowing instructional or technical reference content to creep into explanation, and why should writers be cautious of this?
A1: The main risk of allowing instructional or technical reference content to creep into explanation is that it dilutes the purpose and effectiveness of the explanation itself. By including content that is already covered in other sections of the documentation, writers may confuse readers and detract from the core goal of deepening understanding and providing context.

Q2: How can writers ensure that their explanations remain focused on their intended purpose and avoid overlapping with the functions of other documentation sections?
A2: Writers can ensure that their explanations remain focused by constantly asking themselves whether the content they are including serves to clarify, deepen, or broaden the reader's understanding of the subject. If the content veers into providing instructions or technical descriptions, it should be removed and potentially relocated to the appropriate section of the documentation.

Q3: What are the benefits of maintaining a clear separation between explanation and other forms of documentation, such as tutorials and reference material?
A3: The benefits of maintaining a clear separation between explanation and other forms of documentation include providing a more organized and coherent resource for readers, allowing them to easily locate the type of information they need, and ensuring that each section of the documentation fulfills its intended purpose effectively. By keeping explanation focused on understanding, writers can create more valuable and impactful content.

The language of explanation:

Q1: How can writers use language to provide context and help readers understand the reasons behind certain aspects of a subject?
A1: Writers can use language to provide context and help readers understand the reasons behind certain aspects of a subject by using phrases like "The reason for x is because historically, y..." or "W is better than z, because..." These types of explanations give readers insight into the factors that have influenced the development or current state of the subject.

Q2: In what ways can writers use analogies and comparisons in explanation, and what is the purpose of doing so?
A2: Writers can use analogies and comparisons in explanation by stating things like "An x in system y is analogous to a w in system z." The purpose of using analogies and comparisons is to help readers understand complex or unfamiliar concepts by relating them to something they already know or understand, making the new information more accessible and easier to grasp.

Q3: How can writers balance the inclusion of alternative viewpoints or user preferences in their explanations while still providing clear and cohesive information?
A3: Writers can balance the inclusion of alternative viewpoints or user preferences in their explanations by using language that acknowledges these differences while still providing a clear overall picture. For example, "Some users prefer w (because z). This can be a good approach, but..." This type of language shows that the writer is aware of different perspectives but is still able to offer guidance and insight based on their understanding of the subject.Based on the document, the main sections and topics that we should cover with our Q&A pairs are:

The pragmatic approach to using Diátaxis
Using Diátaxis as a guide rather than a strict plan
Not focusing on structure initially
Working iteratively and taking small steps
The process of applying Diátaxis to improve documentation
Allowing documentation to develop organically
The concept of documentation being complete but never finished
Now, let's generate Q&A pairs for each of these sections to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the document's content.

The pragmatic approach to using Diátaxis:

Q1: What is the main value that Diátaxis offers in helping improve documentation?
A1: The main value of Diátaxis is to be useful in helping make documentation better for its users and easier for the creator to create and maintain.

Q2: How much of Diátaxis should one use when applying it to their documentation?
A2: One should use as much or as little of Diátaxis as seems to work for them, taking from it pragmatically and using it as a guide rather than a strict plan.

Using Diátaxis as a guide rather than a strict plan:

Q3: Is Diátaxis intended to be a plan that must be completed in documentation?
A3: No, Diátaxis is not intended to be a plan that must be completed. It is a guide and a map to help check that the documentation is in the right place and going in the right directions.

Q4: What does Diátaxis provide to help assess and improve documentation?
A4: Diátaxis provides tools that help assess documentation, identify where its problems lie, and judge what can be done to improve it.

Not focusing on structure initially:

Q5: When getting started with Diátaxis, should one focus on dividing documentation into the four sections or writing out headings?
A5: No, when getting started with Diátaxis, one should not focus on dividing documentation into the four sections or writing out headings. Instead, one should follow the prompts that Diátaxis provides and make changes where opportunities for improvement are seen.

Q6: How does the structure of documentation form when using Diátaxis?
A6: When using Diátaxis, the structure of documentation forms from the inside as changes are made according to Diátaxis principles. At a certain point, the changes made will demand that material be moved under a certain Diátaxis heading, and that is how the top-level structure will form.

Working iteratively and taking small steps:

Q7: Is it always possible to improve documentation iteratively, regardless of its current state?
A7: Yes, it is always possible to improve documentation iteratively, even if it's a complete mess by any standards.

Q8: Should one try to complete large tranches of work before publishing when using Diátaxis?
A8: No, one should avoid the temptation to complete large tranches of work before publishing. Every step in the right direction is worth publishing immediately.

The process of applying Diátaxis to improve documentation:

Q9: What is the first step in applying Diátaxis to improve documentation?
A9: The first step in applying Diátaxis is to choose any piece of the documentation, preferably a small thing like a page, paragraph, or sentence.

Q10: What questions should one ask when assessing a piece of documentation according to Diátaxis standards?
A10: When assessing a piece of documentation, one should ask what user need is represented by it, how well it serves that need, what can be added, moved, removed, or changed to serve that need better, and if its language and logic meet the requirements of the mode of documentation.

Q11: What should one do after deciding on a single action to improve a piece of documentation?
A11: After deciding on a single action to improve a piece of documentation, one should complete that action and consider it completed by publishing it or committing the change, without feeling the need to do anything else to make a worthy improvement.

Allowing documentation to develop organically:

Q12: What is a good model for documentation according to the document?
A12: A good model for documentation is well-formed organic growth that adapts to external conditions, where structure is guaranteed by the healthy development of cells according to appropriate rules, rather than being imposed from above or outside.

Q13: How does good structure develop in documentation when using Diátaxis principles?
A13: When using Diátaxis principles, good structure develops in documentation from within, as its internal components become well-formed, building itself up from the inside-out, one cell at a time, like a living organism.

The concept of documentation being complete but never finished:

Q14: Why is documentation never finished, according to the document?
A14: Documentation is never finished because it always has to keep adapting and changing to the product and to users' needs, and can always be developed and improved further.

Q15: What does it mean for documentation to be complete, even if it's not finished?
A15: Documentation can be complete when it is useful to users, appropriate to its current stage of development, in a healthy structural state, and ready to go on to the next stage, even if it's not finished and can be developed further.What they have in common:

Q1: How are tutorials and how-to guides similar in terms of their practical nature and the presence of directions for the user to follow?
A1: Both tutorials and how-to guides are practical guides that contain directions for the user to follow, guiding the user in what to do rather than what there is to know or understand. They set out steps for the reader to follow and promise a successful conclusion if the steps are followed correctly.

Q2: What is the importance of the order in which actions are performed in both tutorials and how-to guides?
A2: In both tutorials and how-to guides, the order in which actions are performed is crucial. The reader cannot expect success unless they perform the actions in the right sequence, as described in the guide.

Q3: Why can tutorials and how-to guides be easily mistaken for one another at first glance?
A3: Tutorials and how-to guides can be easily mistaken for one another because they are closely related, sharing similarities such as describing ordered sequences of actions and requiring the user to have their hands on the machinery, ready to do things.

What matters is what the user needs:

Q1: How does Diátaxis distinguish between tutorials and how-to guides based on user needs?
A1: Diátaxis distinguishes between tutorials and how-to guides by focusing on the needs of the user. A tutorial serves the needs of the user who is at study, with the obligation to provide a successful learning experience. A how-to guide serves the needs of the user who is at work, with the obligation to help the user accomplish a task.

Q2: What is the key difference between the orientation of tutorials and how-to guides?
A2: The key difference between the orientation of tutorials and how-to guides is that tutorials are learning-oriented, focused on helping the user acquire skills, while how-to guides are task-oriented, focused on helping the user apply their skills to accomplish a specific task.

Q3: How does the distinction between tutorials and how-to guides relate to the different needs and obligations of documentation?
A3: The distinction between tutorials and how-to guides matters because it reflects the completely different needs and obligations of documentation in serving users who are either at study (acquiring skills) or at work (applying skills). Recognizing and addressing these distinct needs is crucial for creating effective documentation.

At study and at work:

Q1: In the example of a doctor learning to suture a wound, what key aspects of the learning experience make it a tutorial?
A1: The key aspects that make the wound suturing lesson a tutorial are the presence of a controlled learning environment, step-by-step guidance from a tutor, the opportunity for the learner to practice and make mistakes, and the focus on acquiring basic competence through hands-on experience.

Q2: How does the clinical manual for an appendectomy demonstrate the characteristics of a how-to guide?
A2: The clinical manual for an appendectomy demonstrates the characteristics of a how-to guide by assuming the user's competence, providing step-by-step guidance for accomplishing a specific task, including variations based on real-world conditions, and serving as a reference for the user's work rather than a learning tool.

Q3: What is the key difference between the doctor's need for a tutorial when learning to suture and their need for a how-to guide when performing an appendectomy?
A3: The key difference is that when learning to suture, the doctor is in a study situation, needing a safe, controlled environment to acquire a new skill, while when performing an appendectomy, the doctor is in a work situation, needing guidance to apply their existing skills to accomplish a specific task in the real world.

Understanding the distinction:

Q1: What is the primary purpose of a tutorial, and how does it differ from the purpose of a how-to guide?
A1: The primary purpose of a tutorial is to help the pupil acquire basic competence through a learning experience, while the purpose of a how-to guide is to help the already-competent user perform a particular task correctly by directing their work.

Q2: How do tutorials and how-to guides differ in their approach to the user's familiarity with tools, language, processes, and the behavior of what they're working with?
A2: Tutorials aim to familiarize the learner with tools, language, processes, and the behavior of what they're working with through structured, repeatable encounters in a contrived setting. How-to guides assume the user's familiarity with these elements and apply to real-world situations.

Q3: What is the difference between the way tutorials and how-to guides handle the possibility of the unexpected or choices and alternatives?
A3: Tutorials eliminate the unexpected and do not offer choices or alternatives, following a single, managed path. How-to guides must prepare for the unexpected, alerting the user to its possibility and providing guidance on how to deal with it, and often present different routes to the same destination.

The basic and the advanced:

Q1: Why is it a common but understandable conflation to see the difference between tutorials and how-to guides as the difference between basic and advanced content?
A1: It is a common conflation because tutorials are often associated with learners and covering the basics, while how-to guides are often associated with already-skilled practitioners and dealing with complexities. However, this distinction does not fully capture the difference between the two types of documentation.

Q2: How can a how-to guide cover basic or well-known procedures, despite being intended for already-skilled practitioners?
A2: A how-to guide can cover basic or well-known procedures because its purpose is to help the user accomplish a specific task, regardless of the complexity of that task. Even basic tasks require guidance to ensure they are performed correctly and safely in the real world.

Q3: What is the key factor that determines whether a piece of documentation is a tutorial or a how-to guide, regardless of its complexity?
A3: The key factor that determines whether a piece of documentation is a tutorial or a how-to guide is the need it serves: if it is aimed at helping the user in their study and acquisition of skills, it is a tutorial; if it is aimed at helping the user in their work and application of skills, it is a how-to guide, regardless of the complexity of the content.

Safety and success:

Q1: How can conflating education with practice in a clinical manual have serious consequences, and what does this illustrate about the importance of distinguishing between tutorials and how-to guides?
A1: Conflating education with practice in a clinical manual can have deadly consequences, as it fails to address the distinct needs of users who are either learning a skill or applying it in real-world situations. This illustrates the crucial importance of distinguishing between tutorials and how-to guides to ensure the safety and success of the user.

Q2: How can failing to distinguish between tutorials and how-to guides in software documentation impact users and the success of the product?
A2: Failing to distinguish between tutorials and how-to guides in software documentation can lead to user frustration and inconvenience, as the documentation fails to meet their specific needs at different stages of their interaction with the product. This can ultimately drive users away from the product if they find alternatives that better address their needs.

Q3: Why is the conflation of tutorials and how-to guides particularly harmful to newcomers, and how can getting the distinction right contribute to the success of the product?
A3: The conflation of tutorials and how-to guides is particularly harmful to newcomers because it risks failing to provide them with the appropriate learning experiences and guidance they need to become committed users of the product. Getting the distinction right is a key to success, as it ensures that the documentation effectively supports users throughout their journey, from initial acquisition of skills to real-world application.About how-to guides:

Q1: How do how-to guides help users understand the capabilities of a product?
A1: A rich list of well-written how-to guides that address the right subjects can help frame the picture of what a product can actually do, serving as an encouraging suggestion of the product's capabilities.

Q2: What is the key characteristic that distinguishes how-to guides from other forms of documentation?
A2: How-to guides are goal-oriented, focusing on providing directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a specific real-world problem or achieve a particular end.

Q3: What impact can well-written and relevant how-to guides have on the readership of documentation?
A3: If how-to guides are well-written and address the right subjects, they are likely to be the most-read sections of the documentation, as users seek guidance on accomplishing specific tasks with the product.

Tutorials vs how-to guides:

Q1: What is the main similarity between tutorials and how-to guides that can lead to their conflation?
A1: Both tutorials and how-to guides describe a series of practical steps that lead to the completion of some task, which can easily lead to their conflation in documentation.

Q2: How do the user needs served by tutorials and how-to guides differ, despite their superficial similarity?
A2: Tutorials serve the need for learning and acquiring skills, while how-to guides serve the need for accomplishing specific tasks or solving particular problems. Conflating these distinct user needs is at the root of many difficulties in documentation.

Q3: What is the consequence of conflating tutorials and how-to guides in documentation?
A3: Conflating tutorials and how-to guides can lead to documentation that fails to effectively meet the specific needs of users at different stages of their interaction with the product, causing frustration and potential abandonment of the product.

Food and cooking:

Q1: How does a recipe, as a model for a how-to guide, differ from a cooking lesson in terms of its purpose and the expectations of the user?
A1: A recipe focuses on guiding the user through the steps to make a specific dish, assuming basic competence, while a cooking lesson aims to teach the user how to cook. A user expecting a recipe would be disappointed and annoyed if given a cooking lesson instead.

Q2: Why is a recipe not a substitute for a cooking lesson, even though both provide step-by-step instructions?
A2: A recipe is not a substitute for a cooking lesson because it assumes the user has at least basic competence in cooking and does not aim to teach the foundational skills required to follow the recipe successfully.

Q3: What elements should a good recipe exclude to maintain its focus on the specific dish being made?
A3: A good recipe should exclude teaching, discussion of context or history, and other digressions that distract from the focus on how to make the specific dish, following a well-established format that prioritizes the sequence of actions required.

Writing a good how-to guide:

Q1: How does the starting point and conclusion of a how-to guide differ from those of a tutorial?
A1: Unlike a tutorial, a how-to guide does not need to start at the beginning of the whole story and take the reader to the end. It should provide a starting point that the user knows how to reach and a conclusion that answers a real question, fitting into the user's existing workflow.

Q2: What are the key characteristics of a how-to guide that distinguish it from other forms of documentation?
A2: A how-to guide is focused on tasks or problems, assumes the user knows what they want to achieve, and consists of action and only action, with no digression, explanation, or teaching.

Q3: How does the reliability requirement of a how-to guide differ from that of a tutorial?
A3: While a tutorial needs to have cast-iron repeatability, a how-to guide should be reliable but does not need to meet the same strict standard, as it is intended to be adaptable to real-world use cases.

Solve a problem:

Q1: What should be the primary concern of a how-to guide, and what is the consequence of deviating from this focus?
A1: The primary concern of a how-to guide should be the practical problem or task it aims to solve. Adding unnecessary elements, such as explanations, distracts both the writer and the user and dilutes the useful power of the guide.

Q2: How can a how-to guide maintain its focus on solving a problem while still being adaptable to real-world use cases?
A2: A how-to guide can maintain its focus on solving a problem by sticking to the practical goal and avoiding digressions, while being flexible enough to accommodate variations in real-world use cases, rather than being limited to a single, narrow scenario.

Q3: What is the difference between a tutorial and a how-to guide in terms of their approach to completeness?
A3: While a tutorial needs to be a complete, end-to-end guide, a how-to guide does not. A how-to guide should start and end in a reasonable, meaningful place, requiring the reader to integrate it into their own work, prioritizing practical usability over completeness.

Pay attention to naming:

Q1: What is the key principle for choosing titles for how-to guides?
A1: The key principle for choosing titles for how-to guides is to say exactly what the guide shows, clearly indicating the problem or task that the guide addresses.

Q2: How can a poorly chosen title for a how-to guide mislead users and undermine the effectiveness of the documentation?
A2: A poorly chosen title, such as one that does not clearly indicate whether the guide is about how to do something or whether to do it, can mislead users and cause frustration when the content does not match their expectations, undermining the effectiveness of the documentation.

Q3: Why do search engines appreciate well-chosen titles for how-to guides?
A3: Search engines appreciate well-chosen titles for how-to guides because they help users find the content they need more easily, improving the visibility and discoverability of the documentation in search results.

The language of how-to guides:

Q1: What is the purpose of using conditional imperatives in how-to guides?
A1: Conditional imperatives, such as "If you want x, do y" or "To achieve w, do z," help guide the user through the steps required to solve a problem or achieve a specific goal, making the actions clear and concise.

Q2: How should a how-to guide handle references to additional information or options?
A2: A how-to guide should refer to the relevant reference guide for a full list of options or additional information, rather than attempting to include every possible related action within the guide itself, which would pollute the practical focus of the guide.

Q3: What is the importance of clearly describing the problem or task that a how-to guide addresses?
A3: Clearly describing the problem or task that a how-to guide addresses helps set the context and expectations for the user, ensuring that they understand what the guide will help them accomplish and whether it is relevant to their needs.The map of needs:

Q1: What is a common problem faced by documentation creators when organizing their work?
A1: In the absence of a clear, generalized documentation architecture, documentation creators often try to structure their work around characteristics or features of the product, which rarely leads to successful results.

Q2: How can adopting a scheme that answers the question "how to arrange documentation in general" help improve documentation?
A2: Adopting a scheme that answers this question can improve documentation by providing lists of content types, making it more orderly and consistent for both authors and users.

Q3: What is a limitation of using a list of content types to organize documentation?
A3: Authors may find themselves needing to write content that fails to fit well within the categories provided by a list, or struggling to rewrite existing material to conform to the list.

Q4: Why might authors feel a sense of arbitrariness about the structure they are working with when using a list of content types?
A4: Authors might feel a sense of arbitrariness because there is no clear reason why one particular list of content types is chosen over another, leading to confusion when competing lists are proposed.

The Diátaxis map:

Q5: What is the most immediately striking feature of the Diátaxis framework?
A5: The most immediately striking feature of Diátaxis is its map, which is a memorable and approachable way of organizing documentation.

Q6: How does the two-dimensional structure of the Diátaxis map help guide and shape the documentation material it contains?
A6: The two-dimensional structure of the Diátaxis map helps guide and shape documentation by placing different forms of documentation into relationship with each other, with each one occupying a space in the mental territory it outlines and the boundaries between them highlighting their distinctions.

Q7: What is the key reason why the Diátaxis map is effective as a guide to organizing documentation?
A7: The Diátaxis map is effective as a guide to organizing documentation because it is a map of needs, underpinned by a systematic description and analysis of generalized user needs.

Q8: How does using the Diátaxis map result in documentation that takes less effort to create and maintain?
A8: Using the Diátaxis map results in documentation that takes less effort to create and maintain because it is based on a clear understanding of user needs, providing guidance and structure that makes the process more efficient and effective.

Needs:

Q9: Who is the user whose needs Diátaxis serves?
A9: The user whose needs Diátaxis serves is the practitioner in a domain of skill, such as someone using a programming language, flying a particular aircraft, or engaging in a discipline or profession.

Q10: What does successful engagement in a craft or skill involve?
A10: Successful engagement in a craft or skill involves both theoretical grasp (knowledge and understanding) and an ability to apply that in practice, working with the tools and materials of the craft.

Q11: What are the two modes a practitioner is in at any moment in their craft?
A11: At any moment in their craft, a practitioner is either in the mode of study (learning, acquiring, building up their skill) or the mode of work (applying, using, exercising their skill).

Q12: What are the two needs that documentation must meet to serve the practitioner?
A12: Documentation serving the practitioner must meet the needs both of theory and its practical application, as well as the needs of acquiring and applying knowledge.

Axes of knowledge:

Q13: What are the two axes of knowledge that Diátaxis uses to divide documentation?
A13: Diátaxis divides documentation across two axes of knowledge: theory/practice and acquisition/application.

Q14: What is the difference between documentation that contains theoretical knowledge and documentation that describes practical actions?
A14: Documentation that contains theoretical knowledge focuses on propositional knowledge, while documentation that describes practical actions focuses on the steps and processes involved in doing something.

Q15: What is the difference between documentation that serves the acquisition of knowledge and documentation that serves the application of knowledge?
A15: Documentation that serves the acquisition of knowledge is concerned with helping users learn and build up their skills, while documentation that serves the application of knowledge is concerned with helping users apply their skills to actual work.

Q16: How does organizing documentation across the two axes of knowledge result in the four forms of documentation in the Diátaxis map?
A16: Organizing documentation across the two axes of knowledge results in four forms of documentation: tutorials (theory/acquisition), how-to guides (practice/acquisition), reference (theory/application), and explanation (practice/application).

Characteristics of documentation:

Q17: What are the four forms of documentation in the Diátaxis map, and what are their main purposes?
A17: The four forms of documentation in the Diátaxis map are tutorials (to introduce and educate), how-to guides (to guide and demonstrate), reference (to state, describe, and inform), and explanation (to explain, clarify, and discuss).

Q18: How does organizing documentation according to the Diátaxis map provide clear expectations to the reader and guidance to the author?
A18: Organizing documentation according to the Diátaxis map makes it clear what the purpose of any particular piece of content is, specifies how it should be written, and shows where it should be placed, providing clear expectations to the reader and guidance to the author.

Q19: What is the main difference between tutorials and how-to guides?
A19: The main difference between tutorials and how-to guides is that tutorials are oriented towards learning and aim to introduce and educate, while how-to guides are oriented towards tasks and aim to guide and demonstrate how to solve specific problems.

Q20: What is the main difference between reference and explanation?
A20: The main difference between reference and explanation is that reference is a dry description that states, describes, and informs, while explanation is a discursive exploration that explains, clarifies, and discusses.

Collapse of the structure:

Q21: What is the natural tendency that leads to the blurring of distinctions between the different forms of documentation?
A21: There is a natural affinity between each of the different forms of documentation and its neighbors on the Diátaxis map, which leads to a tendency to blur the distinctions between them.

Q22: What is the most common structural problem that arises when the distinctions between the different forms of documentation are allowed to blur?
A22: The most common structural problem that arises is a complete or partial collapse of tutorials and how-to guides into each other, while explanation spills over into both tutorials and reference material.

Q23: What is the relationship between tutorials and how-to guides that leads to their collapse into each other?
A23: Tutorials and how-to guides both describe practical steps, which leads to a natural tendency for them to collapse into each other when their distinctions are not maintained.

Q24: What is the relationship between reference and explanation that leads to explanation spilling over into reference material?
A24: Reference and explanation both contain theoretical knowledge, which leads to a natural tendency for explanation to spill over into reference material when their distinctions are not maintained.

The cycle of interaction:

Q25: What is the purpose of the cycle of interaction in the Diátaxis framework?
A25: The cycle of interaction in the Diátaxis framework is intended to help documentation better serve users as they progress through different phases of learning and using a product.

Q26: Does a user have to encounter the different kinds of documentation in the order of tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation?
A26: No, a user does not have to encounter the different kinds of documentation in a specific order. In practice, a user may enter the documentation anywhere in search of guidance on a particular subject, and their needs will change from moment to moment as they use the documentation.

Q27: What is the significance of the ordering of the different phases in the cycle of interaction?
A27: While a user may not necessarily encounter the different kinds of documentation in a specific order, the ordering of the phases in the cycle of interaction corresponds to the way that people actually become expert in a craft, progressing from learning to application to reflection.

Q28: What are the four phases of the cycle of interaction, and what is the focus of each phase?
A28: The four phases of the cycle of interaction are the learning-oriented phase (diving straight in to learn a skill), the task-oriented phase (putting the skill to work), the information-oriented phase (consulting technical reference to acquire necessary knowledge), and the explanation-oriented phase (reflecting on practice and knowledge to understand the whole).
The distinction between functional quality and deep quality:

Q1: What is the main difference between functional quality and deep quality in documentation?
A1: Functional quality is objective and can be measured against the world, while deep quality is subjective and assessed against the human user's experience.

Q2: Can documentation have functional quality without exhibiting deep quality?
A2: Yes, documentation can meet all the demands of functional quality, such as accuracy and consistency, and still fail to exhibit deep quality, such as feeling good to use or anticipating the user's needs.

Q3: Are the characteristics of functional quality and deep quality independent of each other?
A3: No, while the characteristics of functional quality are independent of each other, those of deep quality are interdependent and hard to disentangle.

Q4: Is deep quality conditional upon functional quality in documentation?
A4: Yes, deep quality is conditional upon functional quality. Documentation will never have deep quality without being accurate, complete, and consistent.

Characteristics of functional quality and deep quality:

Q5: What are some examples of characteristics of functional quality in documentation?
A5: Examples of characteristics of functional quality in documentation include accuracy, completeness, consistency, usefulness, and precision.

Q6: Can the characteristics of functional quality be objectively measured?
A6: Yes, the characteristics of functional quality can be objectively measured, sometimes even with numbers, such as measuring the completeness of documentation.

Q7: What are some examples of characteristics of deep quality in documentation?
A7: Examples of characteristics of deep quality in documentation include feeling good to use, having flow, fitting to human needs, being beautiful, and anticipating the user.

Q8: Can the characteristics of deep quality be objectively measured?
A8: No, the characteristics of deep quality cannot be objectively measured. They can only be enquired into and assessed through judgement, not measurements.

Recognizing deep quality in documentation:

Q9: Is it necessary to be an expert to recognize when documentation has deep quality?
A9: No, even someone who can't recognize or understand the specific characteristics that make documentation excellent can still realize that it is excellent because it feels good to use and fits their needs well.

Q10: How can users recognize deep quality in documentation, even if they can't articulate why it's good?
A10: Users can recognize deep quality in documentation by the pleasure and satisfaction they feel when using it, as it feels like it fits and moves with them, even if they can't articulate the specific reasons for its excellence.

Q11: What do creators of documentation need to develop to produce work of deep quality?
A11: Creators of documentation need to develop a clear and effective understanding of what makes documentation good, recognizing what is good about it and understanding how people will feel when using it.

Q12: Can users mistake the more obvious aspects of functional quality for deeper excellence in documentation?
A12: Yes, users may recognize only the more obvious aspects of functional quality in documentation, mistaking those for its deeper excellence, but what matters is that the documentation feels good to use.

The role of Diátaxis in achieving quality:

Q13: Can Diátaxis address functional quality in documentation directly?
A13: No, Diátaxis cannot address functional quality in documentation directly, as it is concerned only with certain aspects of deep quality.

Q14: How can Diátaxis serve functional quality, even if it cannot address it directly?
A14: Diátaxis can serve functional quality by exposing lapses in it, such as making gaps in reference documentation more visible or highlighting sections in tutorials where the reader is left to work something out for themselves.

Q15: How does Diátaxis help documentation fit user needs?
A15: Diátaxis helps documentation fit user needs by describing documentation modes that are based on user needs, ensuring that the categories, arrangement of material, relationships, form, and language are all in response to those needs.

Q16: Can using Diátaxis guarantee deep quality in documentation?
A16: No, using Diátaxis does not guarantee deep quality in documentation, as it offers a set of principles, not a formula or a shortcut bypassing the need for skills and insights from disciplines like user experience, interaction design, or visual design.About reference:

Q1: What is the primary purpose of reference guides, and how does this purpose differ from that of tutorials and how-to guides?
A1: The primary purpose of reference guides is to describe the machinery and how to operate it, focusing on providing succinct, orderly information. Unlike tutorials and how-to guides, which are led by the needs of the user, reference material is led by the product it describes.

Q2: Why do users need reference material, and what role does good technical reference play in supporting their work?
A2: Users need reference material because they require truth and certainty—firm platforms on which to stand while they work. Good technical reference is essential to provide users with the confidence to do their work by offering authoritative, accurate information about the product and its internal machinery.

Q3: How does the content of reference guides for software differ from that of other types of documentation?
A3: In the case of software, reference guides describe the software itself—APIs, classes, functions, and so on—and how to use them. This content is distinct from tutorials and how-to guides, which focus on user needs and tasks, and explanation, which provides context and understanding.

Reference as description:

Q1: What characteristics should reference material exhibit to effectively serve its purpose?
A1: Reference material should be austere and to the point, designed for consultation rather than reading. It should be wholly authoritative, leaving no doubt or ambiguity, and providing the user with the information they need without requiring them to verify it themselves.

Q2: How is reference material similar to a map, and what purpose does this similarity serve?
A2: Reference material is like a map in that it tells you what you need to know about the territory (the product and its internal machinery) without having to go out and check the territory for yourself. This similarity serves to provide users with a reliable, accurate representation of the product they can use to navigate and understand it.

Q3: What is a common misconception among software developers regarding auto-generated reference material, and why is this problematic?
A3: Many software developers think that auto-generated reference material, such as API documentation, is all the documentation required. While auto-generated reference can be a powerful way to ensure accuracy, it is not sufficient on its own and should be complemented by other types of documentation that address user needs and provide context.

Food and cooking:

Q1: What type of information might one seek when consulting an encyclopedia about a food ingredient like liquorice?
A1: When consulting an encyclopedia about a food ingredient like liquorice, one might seek accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive information about its properties, chemical composition, interactions with other ingredients, related ingredients or plants, and potential health implications.

Q2: How does the information presented in an encyclopedia article about a food ingredient differ from what one would expect to find in a recipe or cooking guide?
A2: An encyclopedia article about a food ingredient focuses on presenting factual information in a consistent manner across different entries. It does not include recipes or suggestions on how to cook with the ingredient, as its purpose is to inform rather than instruct.

Q3: What are some examples of the types of information one might find in an encyclopedia entry about liquorice?
A3: An encyclopedia entry about liquorice might include information such as its classification as a flowering plant of the bean family Fabaceae, or warnings about potential adverse effects resulting from excessive consumption. These facts help the reader understand the ingredient's nature and characteristics without providing guidance on its use in cooking.

Writing a good reference guide:

Q1: Why is it important for the structure of reference documentation to mirror the structure of the product it describes?
A1: Having the structure of the reference documentation mirror the structure of the product helps users navigate and understand both the documentation and the product simultaneously. Just as a map's correspondence to its territory aids in wayfinding, the logical arrangement of reference material should make sense of the product's architecture and conceptual relationships.

Q2: How can consistency in reference material benefit the reader, and what are some areas where consistency is particularly important?
A2: Consistency in reference material benefits the reader by making the information easier to understand and navigate. Key areas where consistency is important include structure, language, terminology, and tone. While there may be opportunities in other forms of writing to showcase variety and style, reference material is not the place for such flourishes.

Q3: What is the primary job of technical reference, and how can introducing other elements detract from this job?
A3: The primary job of technical reference is to describe the product clearly, accurately, and comprehensively. Introducing other elements such as instruction, explanation, discussion, or speculation can distract from this core purpose and make it harder for the reader to find the information they need. Instead, reference material should link to other types of documentation where appropriate.

Provide examples:

Q1: How can examples be used to enhance reference material without detracting from its primary purpose?
A1: Examples can be used to provide illustration that helps readers understand reference material without becoming a distraction from the job of describing. For instance, an example of usage of a command can succinctly illustrate the command and its context, enhancing the reader's understanding without deviating from the reference format.

Q2: What is the key difference between examples in reference material and examples in tutorials or how-to guides?
A2: Examples in reference material serve to illustrate and clarify the description of the product, while examples in tutorials or how-to guides are used to guide the user through a learning process or task. Reference examples should be concise and focused on illuminating the product's characteristics, rather than teaching or instructing.

Q3: How can writers ensure that examples in reference material are effective and appropriate?
A3: To ensure that examples in reference material are effective and appropriate, writers should focus on creating examples that are directly relevant to the item being described, provide clear and concise illustration, and avoid introducing extraneous information or instructions. The examples should be carefully chosen to enhance understanding without detracting from the overall purpose of the reference guide.

Be accurate:

Q1: Why is accuracy so critical in reference material, and what are the potential consequences of discrepancies between the product and its description?
A1: Accuracy is critical in reference material because users rely on it as a source of truth and certainty about the product. Any discrepancies between the product and its description in the reference guide will inevitably lead users astray, causing confusion, errors, and potentially damaging trust in the documentation as a whole.

Q2: How can writers ensure that reference material remains accurate and up-to-date, particularly in the context of evolving products?
A2: To ensure that reference material remains accurate and up-to-date, writers must establish processes for regularly reviewing and updating the documentation in line with changes to the product. This may involve close collaboration with product teams, automated checks, and user feedback channels to identify and address any discrepancies as soon as they arise.

Q3: What role can automation play in maintaining the accuracy of reference material, and what are the limitations of this approach?
A3: Automation, such as auto-generating reference documentation from code, can play a significant role in maintaining accuracy by ensuring that the documentation remains in sync with the product as it evolves. However, this approach has limitations, as auto-generated material may lack context, examples, and other elements that enhance understanding, and may require manual review and enhancement to be fully effective.

The language of reference guides:

Q1: What types of language and structures are commonly used in reference guides to describe the machinery and its behavior?
A1: Reference guides commonly use language and structures such as "X is an example of Y," "W needs to be initialized using Z," or "This option does that" to state facts about the machinery and its behavior. These concise, declarative statements help to clearly and accurately describe the product without introducing ambiguity or extraneous information.

Q2: How can lists be employed in reference material to effectively convey information about the product?
A2: Lists can be employed in reference material to effectively convey information such as commands, options, operations, features, flags, limitations, and error messages. By presenting this information in a clear, ordered format, lists make it easy for users to quickly find and understand the specific items they need to reference.

Q3: What role do warnings and imperatives play in reference material, and how should they be used?
A3: Warnings and imperatives, such as "You must use A," "You must not apply B unless C," or "Never D," play an important role in reference material by alerting users to critical requirements, limitations, or potential dangers associated with the product. These statements should be used judiciously and precisely to convey essential information without overwhelming the user or detracting from the overall clarity of the reference guide.Here are 20 additional Q&A pairs that aim to fill in any gaps and provide a comprehensive overview of the Diátaxis framework:

Q1: What is the main goal of the Diátaxis framework?
A1: The main goal of the Diátaxis framework is to provide a structured approach to creating effective documentation that meets the needs of users at different stages of their engagement with a product or topic.

Q2: How does the Diátaxis framework differentiate between the four types of documentation it defines?
A2: The Diátaxis framework differentiates between tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation based on the specific user needs they address, such as learning, doing, information lookup, and understanding.

Q3: What is the role of user needs in shaping the structure and content of documentation according to the Diátaxis framework?
A3: User needs are central to the Diátaxis framework, as the structure and content of documentation are designed to address the specific requirements of users at different points in their journey, such as learning a new skill, applying knowledge to a task, looking up information, or gaining deeper understanding.

Q4: How does the Diátaxis framework help documentation authors create more effective and targeted content?
A4: The Diátaxis framework helps documentation authors create more effective and targeted content by providing clear guidelines for structuring and writing documentation based on user needs, ensuring that each type of content is focused, relevant, and tailored to its specific purpose.

Q5: What is the significance of the two axes (theory/practice and acquisition/application) in the Diátaxis framework?
A5: The two axes in the Diátaxis framework, theory/practice and acquisition/application, help to define the four distinct types of documentation by considering the nature of the content (theoretical or practical) and the user's stage of engagement (acquiring knowledge or applying it).

Q6: How can documentation authors use the Diátaxis framework to identify gaps or weaknesses in their existing documentation?
A6: Documentation authors can use the Diátaxis framework to identify gaps or weaknesses in their existing documentation by assessing whether they have adequate coverage of all four types of content (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation) and whether each type of content is effectively meeting its intended purpose.

Q7: What are some common pitfalls or challenges that documentation authors may encounter when applying the Diátaxis framework?
A7: Some common pitfalls or challenges when applying the Diátaxis framework include conflating different types of content (e.g., mixing tutorial and how-to guide content), neglecting one or more types of documentation, or failing to adapt the framework to the specific needs of their product or audience.

Q8: How can the Diátaxis framework be adapted to handle complex documentation scenarios, such as products with multiple use cases or user types?

Q1: What is the primary goal of a tutorial in the context of product documentation?
A1: The primary goal of a tutorial is to help a beginner achieve basic competence with a product, so that they can go on to use the product for their own purposes.

Q2: How does a tutorial help a learner become successful with a product?
A2: A tutorial helps a learner become successful with a product by having them do something both meaningful and attainable, demonstrating that they can achieve success with the product.

Q3: What type of knowledge is a tutorial concerned with, and how does it differ from theoretical knowledge?
A3: A tutorial is concerned with practical knowledge, or skill, rather than theoretical knowledge. It is focused on learning how to do something, rather than learning about something.

The tutorial as a lesson:

Q1: What is the key factor that determines what a pupil will learn in a lesson?
A1: What matters most in determining what a pupil will learn is what the teacher gets the pupil to do, rather than the facts and explanations presented in the teaching.

Q2: How can a tutorial provide a learning experience for the user?
A2: A tutorial can provide a learning experience by focusing on what the user does, guiding them through a series of steps and activities that enable them to learn.

Q3: What is the relationship between a teacher and a pupil in the context of a lesson?
A3: In a lesson, there is a relationship between the teacher and the pupil, where the teacher has responsibility for what the pupil will learn, what the pupil will do to learn it, and for the pupil's success.

Obligations of the teacher:

Q1: What are the key responsibilities of the teacher in a tutorial lesson?
A1: The teacher is responsible for determining what the pupil is to learn, what the pupil will do in order to learn it, and for ensuring the pupil's success in learning.

Q2: What is the pupil's main responsibility in the context of a tutorial lesson?
A2: The pupil's main responsibility is to be attentive and follow the teacher's directions as closely as they can. They are not responsible for learning, understanding, or remembering - only for doing things as directed.

Q3: What are the key characteristics of the exercise that a teacher puts a pupil through in a tutorial?
A3: The exercise a teacher puts a pupil through in a tutorial must be meaningful (providing a sense of achievement), successful (able to be completed), logical (following a path that makes sense), and usefully complete (encountering all necessary actions, concepts, and tools).

The problem of tutorials:

Q1: Why are tutorials often considered the weakest part of documentation?
A1: Tutorials are often the weakest part of documentation because they are the most misunderstood and the most difficult to do well, leading to many software projects having poor or non-existent tutorials.

Q2: How does the effort required to create and maintain tutorials compare to other parts of documentation?
A2: The effort required to create and maintain tutorials is much greater than that required for other parts of documentation, as they demand a significant amount of work to ensure they continue to provide an effective learning experience as the product evolves.

Q3: Why are tutorials more prone to revisions compared to other parts of documentation?
A3: Tutorials are more prone to revisions because, in addition to needing updates when the product changes, they may need to be completely rewritten if the author discovers a better way to produce a learning experience for the pupil.

Food and cooking:

Q1: What is the most important outcome when teaching a child to cook?
A1: The most important outcome when teaching a child to cook is that the child enjoys the experience of working in the kitchen, gains confidence, and wants to do it again.

Q2: How does a child learn important things about cooking over time?
A2: A child learns important things about cooking through repetition, over time, such as how to hold a knife, the importance of washing hands before handling food, how to use measuring equipment, and how to time things.

Q3: How should a teacher handle a situation where a lesson with a young child has to end before completing what was set out to do?
A3: When a lesson with a young child has to end before completing the planned activities, it is normal and expected. As long as the child achieved something, however small, and enjoyed doing it, they will have laid down a foundation in their technical expertise that can be built upon next time.

Writing a good tutorial:

Q1: What is the main goal of a tutorial, and how can it be achieved?
A1: The main goal of a tutorial is to allow the user to learn, which can be achieved by giving them things to do through which they can learn, rather than trying to teach them directly.

Q2: What are some common anti-pedagogical temptations that should be avoided when writing a tutorial?
A2: Common anti-pedagogical temptations to avoid when writing a tutorial include abstraction, generalization, explanation, offering choices, and providing excessive information.

Q3: How should a tutorial introduce the user to the tools and operations they need to become familiar with?
A3: A tutorial should introduce the user to the tools and operations they need to become familiar with by leading them through steps that use these tools and perform these operations, building up from the simplest ones at the start to more complex ones.

Get the user started:

Q1: What is the main purpose of a tutorial for beginners?
A1: The main purpose of a tutorial for beginners is to get the learner started and help them set out safely on their journey, not to turn them into an expert or get them to a final destination.

Q2: Why is it acceptable for a tutorial to teach beginners in a way that is not necessarily the way an experienced person would do things?
A2: It is acceptable for a tutorial to teach beginners in a way that is not how an experienced person would do things because a tutorial for beginners is not the same as a manual for best practice. The focus is on helping the learner get started, not on teaching the most optimal methods.

Q3: When is it reasonable to set a higher threshold for the starting level of a tutorial?
A3: It is reasonable to set a higher threshold for the starting level of a tutorial if you decide that you don't want the responsibility of teaching beginners below a certain level, or if you judge that a certain level of skill is a reasonable prerequisite for using the product at all.

Provide a complete picture before they start:

Q1: Why is it important to allow the learner to form an idea of what they will achieve right from the start of a tutorial?
A1: Allowing the learner to form an idea of what they will achieve right from the start helps set expectations and enables them to see themselves building towards the completed goal as they work through the tutorial.

Q2: How can providing the learner with a complete picture at the beginning of a tutorial be accomplished?
A2: Providing the learner with a complete picture at the beginning of a tutorial can be as simple as informing them of what they will build or accomplish by the end of the tutorial, such as creating a specific type of application or deploying it using a particular tool.

Q3: Why should surprising the learner with the result at the end of a tutorial be avoided?
A3: Surprising the learner with the result at the end of a tutorial should be avoided because it diminishes, rather than augments, the value of what they achieve. It is better to provide a clear picture of the end goal from the start.

Ensure that the tutorial works reliably:

Q1: What is one of the most important requirements for building a learner's confidence in a tutorial?
A1: One of the most important requirements for building a learner's confidence in a tutorial is ensuring that what you ask the beginner to do must work reliably.

Q2: How can a tutorial maintain a friendly tone and logical progression?
A2: A tutorial can maintain a friendly tone through consistent use of language and by following a logical progression through the material, building up the learner's knowledge and skills step by step.

Q3: Why is it important to create a reliable experience in a tutorial, even though it may be hard work?
A3: Creating a reliable experience in a tutorial is important because the learner needs to see that when they follow your directions, they will attain the results you promise, which is essential for building their confidence and keeping them engaged.

Ensure the user sees results immediately:

Q1: Why should a tutorial ensure that the user sees results immediately after performing an action?
A1: A tutorial should ensure that the user sees results immediately after performing an action because the effect of every action should be clear to them as soon as possible, making the relation of cause and effect evident.

Q2: What should be the nature of the results that a user sees after each step in a tutorial?
A2: Each result that a user sees after following a step in a tutorial should be something that they can perceive as meaningful, however small it may be.

Q3: How can a tutorial help users who are doing new and strange things that they don't understand?
A3: A tutorial can help users who are doing new and strange things that they don't understand by ensuring that every step they follow produces a comprehensible result, allowing them to see the effects of their actions and build understanding incrementally.

Make your tutorial repeatable:

Q1: Why is it extremely hard to achieve repeatable reliability in a tutorial?
A1: Achieving repeatable reliability in a tutorial is extremely hard because users will have different levels of skill and understanding, and may be using different tools and operating systems, making it difficult to ensure a consistent experience for all.

Q2: What is the importance of making a tutorial work for all users, every time?
A2: Making a tutorial work for all users, every time, is crucial because it ensures that the learning experience is consistent and reliable, regardless of the user's background or environment.

Q3: What is the only way to ensure that a tutorial continues to work as expected over time?
A3: The only way to ensure that a tutorial continues to work as expected over time is to test it regularly, making sure that it remains reliable and effective for all users.

Describe concrete steps, not abstract concepts:

Q1: What should a tutorial be composed of, and what should it avoid?
A1: A tutorial should be composed of concrete steps and specific, particular actions and outcomes. It should avoid abstract discussions and resist the temptation to introduce abstraction.

Q2: How does learning proceed, and what does this mean for the structure of a tutorial?
A2: Learning proceeds from the particular and concrete to the general and abstract. A tutorial should focus on providing concrete examples and steps, leaving abstract concepts and patterns for later, after the learner has gained sufficient experience.

Q3: Why is it hard to resist the temptation to introduce abstraction in a tutorial?
A3: It is hard to resist the temptation to introduce abstraction in a tutorial because once we have grasped something, we rely on the power of abstraction to frame it to ourselves, and we want to frame it to others in the same way. However, this is not how learning or successful teaching works.

Offer only minimum, necessary, explanation:

Q1: What should be the approach to providing explanations in a tutorial?
A1: In a tutorial, explanations should be provided only if the learner needs them to complete the tutorial. If an explanation is not necessary for the learner to follow the steps and achieve the desired result, it should be omitted.

Q2: How can a tutorial handle situations where some explanation seems necessary, but a full discussion is not required?
A2: When some explanation seems necessary, but a full discussion is not required, a tutorial can provide a brief, simple explanation, such as stating that a particular technology is being used because it is more secure, without going into extensive detail.

Q3: What should a tutorial do if the author feels that additional explanatory material is required?
A3: If the author feels that additional explanatory material is required, they can include links to further resources, but should resist the temptation to interrupt the flow of the tutorial by digressing into lengthy explanations.

Ignore options and alternatives:

Q1: What should be the focus of a tutorial when guiding the learner?
A1: When guiding the learner, a tutorial should focus on what is required to reach the desired conclusion, ignoring any interesting diversions, options, or alternatives along the way.

Q2: How does ignoring options and alternatives benefit a tutorial?
A2: Ignoring options and alternatives helps keep a tutorial shorter and crisper, saving both the author and the reader from having to do extra cognitive work.

Q3: When should the learner explore different options, ways of using an API, or approaches to a task?
A3: The learner should explore different options, ways of using an API, or approaches to a task at a later time, after they have successfully completed the tutorial and reached the desired conclusion.

The language of tutorials:

Q1: How should a tutorial describe what the learner will accomplish?
A1: A tutorial should describe what the learner will accomplish using language like "In this tutorial, you will...", focusing on the outcome they will achieve, rather than what they will learn.

Q2: What kind of language should be used when providing explanations in a tutorial?
A2: When providing explanations in a tutorial, the language should be as basic as possible, offering minimal explanation of actions and linking to more detailed information if necessary.

Q3: How can a tutorial help the learner confirm they are on the right track and orient themselves?
A3: A tutorial can help the learner confirm they are on the right track and orient themselves by providing plenty of clues, using language like "Notice that..." or "Remember that..." to draw attention to key points and reinforce understanding.
