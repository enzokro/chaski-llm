You will be shown a series of documents. Please read the documents carefully and make sure you understand the key information, main ideas, and important details that it contains. As you read, think of questions that could be answered based on the information provided in the document. The questions should be things that someone who read the document carefully should know the answers to. For each question you come up with, note down the answer to it based on the content of the document. Only include questions that can be answered directly from the document, without speculation or external knowledge. Please format your output as a numbered list of question-and-answer pairs, with each question on its own line preceded by "Q:" and the corresponding answer on the following line preceded by "A:". For example: ``` Q1: What is the capital of France? A1: Paris Q2: What is the largest ocean in the world? A2: The Pacific Ocean ``` Think carefully about what key facts and ideas from the document are important to capture in your questions. Aim to create a set of question-and-answer pairs that demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the document's content. Start by listing the different topics and areas of the document that a reader would be expected to understand. We will then generate several groups of Q&A pairs from the documents. There will be multiple rounds of pair generation for the different sections. Our goal is to have a complete and accurate coverage of the document's content, with as many pairs as needed.
