It can be used\\nto add a rotation offset to the Bokeh shape. The value is the angle in\\ndegrees.\\nGamma Correction\\nApplies a gamma correction on the image before and after blurring it.\\nF-Stop\\nThis option controls the amount of focal blur in the same way as a real\\ncamera.

This value controls how large that blur difference considered\\nto be safe.\\nTip\\nOnly change this value, if there is an occurring problem with an in-focus\\nobject.\\nPreview\\nIf enabled a limited amount of (quasi-)random samples are used to render the\\npreview.

No Z-buffer will be\\nenabled automatically whenever a node that is not image based is connected to\\nthe Z input.\\nZ Scale\\nOnly active when _No Z-buffer_ is enabled. When _No Z-buffer_ is used, the\\ninput is used directly to control the blur radius (similar to _F-Stop_ when\\nusing the Z-buffer). This parameter can be used to scale the range of the Z\\ninput.\\n## Outputs\\nImage\\nStandard color output.\\n## Examples\\nIn this [blend-file\\nexample](https://archive.blender.org/wiki/uploads/7/79/Doftest.blend), the\\nball array image is blurred as if it was taken by a camera with an f-stop of\\n2.8 resulting in a fairly narrow depth of field centered on 7.5 units from the\\ncamera. As the balls recede into the distance, they get blurrier.\\n### No Z-Buffer Examples\\nSometimes might want to have more control to blur the image. For instance, you\\nmay want to only blur one object while leaving everything else alone (or the\\nother way around), or you want to blur the whole image uniformly all at once.\\nThe node, therefore, allows you to use something other than an actual Z-buffer\\nas the Z input. For instance, you could connect an Image node and use a\\ngrayscale image where the color designates how much to blur the image at that\\npoint, where white is the maximum blur and black is no blur. Or, you could use\\na Time node to uniformly blur the image, where the time value controls the\\nmaximum blur for that frame. It may also be used to obtain a possibly slightly\\nbetter DoF blur, by using a fake depth-shaded image instead of a Z-buffer. (A\\ntypical method to create the fake depth-shaded image is by using a linear\\nblend texture for all objects in the scene or by using the “fog/mist” fake\\ndepth shading method.) This also has the advantage that the fake depth image\\ncan have [Anti-Aliasing](../../../glossary/index.html#term-Anti-Aliasing),\\nwhich is not possible with a real Z-buffer.\\nThe parameter _No Z-buffer_ , becomes then the main blur control. The input\\nhas to be scaled, because usually the value of a texture is only in the\\nnumeric range 0.0 to 1.0.\\n### Camera Settings\\nDistance setting in the Camera Depth of Field panel.\\nThe _Defocus_ node uses the actual camera data in your scene if supplied by a\\n_Render Layer_ node.\\nTo set the point of focus, the camera now has a _Distance_ parameter, which is\\nshorthand for Depth of Field Distance. Use this camera parameter to set the\\nfocal plane of the camera (objects Depth of Field Distance away from the\\ncamera are in focus). Set _Distance_ in the main _Camera_ edit panel; the\\nbutton is right below the _Depth of Field_.\\nTo make the focal point visible, enable the camera _Limits_ option, the focal\\npoint is then visible as a yellow cross along the view direction of the\\ncamera.\\n### Hints\\nPreview\\nIn general, use preview mode, change parameters to your liking, only then\\ndisable preview mode for the final render.\\nEdge Artifacts\\nFor minimum artifacts, try to setup your scene such that differences in\\ndistances between two objects that may visibly overlap at some point are not\\ntoo large.\\n“Focus Pull”\\nKeep in mind that this is not real DoF, only a post-processing simulation.\\nSome things cannot be done which would be no problem for real DoF at all. A\\ntypical example is a scene with some object very close to the camera, and the\\ncamera focusing on some point far behind it. In the real world, using shallow\\ndepth of field, it is not impossible for nearby objects to become completely\\ninvisible, in effect allowing the camera to see behind them. Hollywood\\ncinematographers use this visual characteristic to achieve the popular “focus\\npull” effect, where the focus shifts from a nearby to a distant object, such\\nthat the “other” object all but disappears. Well, this is simply not possible\\nto do with the current post-processing method in a single pass. If you really\\nwant to achieve this effect, quite satisfactorily, here is how:\\n  * Split up your scene into “nearby” and “far” objects, and render them in two passes.\\n  * Now, combine the two results, each with their own “defocus” nodes driven by the same Time node, but with one of them inverted (e.g. using a Map Value node with a Size of -1). As the defocus of one increases, the defocus on the other decreases at the same rate, creating a smooth transition.\\nAliasing at Low f-Stop Values\\nAt very low values, less than 5, the node will start to remove any\\noversampling and bring the objects at DoF Distance very sharply into focus. If\\nthe object is against a contrasting background, this may lead to visible\\nstair-stepping (aliasing) which OSA is designed to avoid. If you run into this\\nproblem:\\n  * Do your own OSA by rendering at twice the intended size and then scaling down, so that adjacent pixels are blurred together.\\n  * Use the Blur node with a setting of 2 for X and Y.\\n  * Set DoF Distance off by a little, so that the object in focus is blurred by the tiniest bit.\\n  * Use a higher f-stop, which will start the blur, and then use the Z socket to a Map Value to a Blur node to enhance the blur effect.\\n  * Rearrange the objects in your scene to use a lower-contrast background.\\nNo Z-Buffer\\nA final word of warning, since there is no way to detect if an actual Z-buffer\\nis connected to the node, be **very** careful with the _No Z-buffer_ switch.\\nIf the _Z scale_ value happens to be large, and you forget to set it back to\\nsome low value, the values may suddenly be interpreted as huge blur radius\\nvalues that will cause processing times to explode.']\n",

As the balls recede into the distance, they get blurrier.\\n### No Z-Buffer Examples\\nSometimes might want to have more control to blur the image. For instance, you\\nmay want to only blur one object while leaving everything else alone (or the\\nother way around), or you want to blur the whole image uniformly all at once.\\nThe node, therefore, allows you to use something other than an actual Z-buffer\\nas the Z input. For instance, you could connect an Image node and use a\\ngrayscale image where the color designates how much to blur the image at that\\npoint, where white is the maximum blur and black is no blur. Or, you could use\\na Time node to uniformly blur the image, where the time value controls the\\nmaximum blur for that frame. It may also be used to obtain a possibly slightly\\nbetter DoF blur, by using a fake depth-shaded image instead of a Z-buffer. (A\\ntypical method to create the fake depth-shaded image is by using a linear\\nblend texture for all objects in the scene or by using the “fog/mist” fake\\ndepth shading method.) This also has the advantage that the fake depth image\\ncan have [Anti-Aliasing](../../../glossary/index.html#term-Anti-Aliasing),\\nwhich is not possible with a real Z-buffer.\\nThe parameter _No Z-buffer_ , becomes then the main blur control. The input\\nhas to be scaled, because usually the value of a texture is only in the\\nnumeric range 0.0 to 1.0.\\n### Camera Settings\\nDistance setting in the Camera Depth of Field panel.\\nThe _Defocus_ node uses the actual camera data in your scene if supplied by a\\n_Render Layer_ node.\\nTo set the point of focus, the camera now has a _Distance_ parameter, which is\\nshorthand for Depth of Field Distance. Use this camera parameter to set the\\nfocal plane of the camera (objects Depth of Field Distance away from the\\ncamera are in focus). Set _Distance_ in the main _Camera_ edit panel; the\\nbutton is right below the _Depth of Field_.\\nTo make the focal point visible, enable the camera _Limits_ option, the focal\\npoint is then visible as a yellow cross along the view direction of the\\ncamera.\\n### Hints\\nPreview\\nIn general, use preview mode, change parameters to your liking, only then\\ndisable preview mode for the final render.\\nEdge Artifacts\\nFor minimum artifacts, try to setup your scene such that differences in\\ndistances between two objects that may visibly overlap at some point are not\\ntoo large.\\n“Focus Pull”\\nKeep in mind that this is not real DoF, only a post-processing simulation.\\nSome things cannot be done which would be no problem for real DoF at all. A\\ntypical example is a scene with some object very close to the camera, and the\\ncamera focusing on some point far behind it. In the real world, using shallow\\ndepth of field, it is not impossible for nearby objects to become completely\\ninvisible, in effect allowing the camera to see behind them. Hollywood\\ncinematographers use this visual characteristic to achieve the popular “focus\\npull” effect, where the focus shifts from a nearby to a distant object, such\\nthat the “other” object all but disappears. Well, this is simply not possible\\nto do with the current post-processing method in a single pass. If you really\\nwant to achieve this effect, quite satisfactorily, here is how:\\n  * Split up your scene into “nearby” and “far” objects, and render them in two passes.\\n  * Now, combine the two results, each with their own “defocus” nodes driven by the same Time node, but with one of them inverted (e.g. using a Map Value node with a Size of -1). As the defocus of one increases, the defocus on the other decreases at the same rate, creating a smooth transition.\\nAliasing at Low f-Stop Values\\nAt very low values, less than 5, the node will start to remove any\\noversampling and bring the objects at DoF Distance very sharply into focus. If\\nthe object is against a contrasting background, this may lead to visible\\nstair-stepping (aliasing) which OSA is designed to avoid. If you run into this\\nproblem:\\n  * Do your own OSA by rendering at twice the intended size and then scaling down, so that adjacent pixels are blurred together.\\n  * Use the Blur node with a setting of 2 for X and Y.\\n  * Set DoF Distance off by a little, so that the object in focus is blurred by the tiniest bit.\\n  * Use a higher f-stop, which will start the blur, and then use the Z socket to a Map Value to a Blur node to enhance the blur effect.\\n  * Rearrange the objects in your scene to use a lower-contrast background.\\nNo Z-Buffer\\nA final word of warning, since there is no way to detect if an actual Z-buffer\\nis connected to the node, be **very** careful with the _No Z-buffer_ switch.\\nIf the _Z scale_ value happens to be large, and you forget to set it back to\\nsome low value, the values may suddenly be interpreted as huge blur radius\\nvalues that will cause processing times to explode.']\n",

But also allows to blur images that are not based on Z\\ndepth too.\\n## Inputs\\nImage\\nStandard color input.\\nZ\\nZ-buffer input, but could also be a (grayscale) image used as a mask, or a\\nsingle value input.\\n## Properties\\nBokeh Type\\nThe number of iris blades of the virtual camera’s diaphragm.\\nDisk (to emulate a perfect circle), Triangle (3 blades), Square (4 blades),\\nPentagon (5 blades), Hexagon (6 blades), Heptagon (7 blades) or Octagon (8\\nblades).\\nAngle\\nThis slider is deactivated, if the Bokeh Type is set to Disk. It can be used\\nto add a rotation offset to the Bokeh shape. The value is the angle in\\ndegrees.\\nGamma Correction\\nApplies a gamma correction on the image before and after blurring it.\\nF-Stop\\nThis option controls the amount of focal blur in the same way as a real\\ncamera. It simulates the aperture _f_ of a real lens’ iris, without modifying\\nthe luminosity of the picture. The default value 128 is assumed to be\\ninfinity: everything is in perfect focus. Half the value will double the\\namount of blur. This slider is deactivated, if _No Z-buffer_ is enabled.\\nMax Blur\\nThis value limits the amount of blur by setting a maximum blur radius. Can be\\nused to optimize the performance. The default value of 0 means no limit.\\nThreshold\\nSome artifacts, like edge bleed, may occur, if the blur difference between\\npixels is large. This value controls how large that blur difference considered\\nto be safe.\\nTip\\nOnly change this value, if there is an occurring problem with an in-focus\\nobject.\\nPreview\\nIf enabled a limited amount of (quasi-)random samples are used to render the\\npreview. This way of sampling introduces additional noise, which will not show\\nup in the final render.\\nScene\\nTo select the linked scene.\\nNo Z-buffer\\nShould be activated for a non Z-buffer in the Z input. No Z-buffer will be\\nenabled automatically whenever a node that is not image based is connected to\\nthe Z input.\\nZ Scale\\nOnly active when _No Z-buffer_ is enabled. When _No Z-buffer_ is used, the\\ninput is used directly to control the blur radius (similar to _F-Stop_ when\\nusing the Z-buffer). This parameter can be used to scale the range of the Z\\ninput.\\n## Outputs\\nImage\\nStandard color output.\\n## Examples\\nIn this [blend-file\\nexample](https://archive.blender.org/wiki/uploads/7/79/Doftest.blend), the\\nball array image is blurred as if it was taken by a camera with an f-stop of\\n2.8 resulting in a fairly narrow depth of field centered on 7.5 units from the\\ncamera. As the balls recede into the distance, they get blurrier.\\n### No Z-Buffer Examples\\nSometimes might want to have more control to blur the image. For instance, you\\nmay want to only blur one object while leaving everything else alone (or the\\nother way around), or you want to blur the whole image uniformly all at once.\\nThe node, therefore, allows you to use something other than an actual Z-buffer\\nas the Z input. For instance, you could connect an Image node and use a\\ngrayscale image where the color designates how much to blur the image at that\\npoint, where white is the maximum blur and black is no blur. Or, you could use\\na Time node to uniformly blur the image, where the time value controls the\\nmaximum blur for that frame. It may also be used to obtain a possibly slightly\\nbetter DoF blur, by using a fake depth-shaded image instead of a Z-buffer. (A\\ntypical method to create the fake depth-shaded image is by using a linear\\nblend texture for all objects in the scene or by using the “fog/mist” fake\\ndepth shading method.) This also has the advantage that the fake depth image\\ncan have [Anti-Aliasing](../../../glossary/index.html#term-Anti-Aliasing),\\nwhich is not possible with a real Z-buffer.\\nThe parameter _No Z-buffer_ , becomes then the main blur control. The input\\nhas to be scaled, because usually the value of a texture is only in the\\nnumeric range 0.0 to 1.0.\\n### Camera Settings\\nDistance setting in the Camera Depth of Field panel.\\nThe _Defocus_ node uses the actual camera data in your scene if supplied by a\\n_Render Layer_ node.\\nTo set the point of focus, the camera now has a _Distance_ parameter, which is\\nshorthand for Depth of Field Distance. Use this camera parameter to set the\\nfocal plane of the camera (objects Depth of Field Distance away from the\\ncamera are in focus). Set _Distance_ in the main _Camera_ edit panel; the\\nbutton is right below the _Depth of Field_.\\nTo make the focal point visible, enable the camera _Limits_ option, the focal\\npoint is then visible as a yellow cross along the view direction of the\\ncamera.\\n### Hints\\nPreview\\nIn general, use preview mode, change parameters to your liking, only then\\ndisable preview mode for the final render.\\nEdge Artifacts\\nFor minimum artifacts, try to setup your scene such that differences in\\ndistances between two objects that may visibly overlap at some point are not\\ntoo large.\\n“Focus Pull”\\nKeep in mind that this is not real DoF, only a post-processing simulation.\\nSome things cannot be done which would be no problem for real DoF at all. A\\ntypical example is a scene with some object very close to the camera, and the\\ncamera focusing on some point far behind it. In the real world, using shallow\\ndepth of field, it is not impossible for nearby objects to become completely\\ninvisible, in effect allowing the camera to see behind them. Hollywood\\ncinematographers use this visual characteristic to achieve the popular “focus\\npull” effect, where the focus shifts from a nearby to a distant object, such\\nthat the “other” object all but disappears. Well, this is simply not possible\\nto do with the current post-processing method in a single pass. If you really\\nwant to achieve this effect, quite satisfactorily, here is how:\\n  * Split up your scene into “nearby” and “far” objects, and render them in two passes.\\n  * Now, combine the two results, each with their own “defocus” nodes driven by the same Time node, but with one of them inverted (e.g. using a Map Value node with a Size of -1). As the defocus of one increases, the defocus on the other decreases at the same rate, creating a smooth transition.\\nAliasing at Low f-Stop Values\\nAt very low values, less than 5, the node will start to remove any\\noversampling and bring the objects at DoF Distance very sharply into focus. If\\nthe object is against a contrasting background, this may lead to visible\\nstair-stepping (aliasing) which OSA is designed to avoid. If you run into this\\nproblem:\\n  * Do your own OSA by rendering at twice the intended size and then scaling down, so that adjacent pixels are blurred together.\\n  * Use the Blur node with a setting of 2 for X and Y.\\n  * Set DoF Distance off by a little, so that the object in focus is blurred by the tiniest bit.\\n  * Use a higher f-stop, which will start the blur, and then use the Z socket to a Map Value to a Blur node to enhance the blur effect.\\n  * Rearrange the objects in your scene to use a lower-contrast background.\\nNo Z-Buffer\\nA final word of warning, since there is no way to detect if an actual Z-buffer\\nis connected to the node, be **very** careful with the _No Z-buffer_ switch.\\nIf the _Z scale_ value happens to be large, and you forget to set it back to\\nsome low value, the values may suddenly be interpreted as huge blur radius\\nvalues that will cause processing times to explode.']\n"

To this\\nend think about a drawing at a scale of 50:1 - a line of width 0.5mm is\\neffectively 25mm thick in the real world.

Options _Unit_ is the length of a\\nunit (a small cylinder): several of such units are put together forming\\nactually the stick (cylinder). The longer the unit length is the less is the\\nnumber of such units and thus the faster is the displaying. However, if the\\nunit length is too long the stick becomes eventually longer than the bond\\nlength (distance between atoms).

If you want to scale the character’s\\ngeometry, we suggest you to first scale up the character in Object Mode, then\\napply the geometry scale with the _Apply Scale_ tool.\\n#### Rigify Human Alignment Tips\\n* Limbs: Keep the legs as straight as possible in the front view (Rigify human works better in predictable cases).

       "  '* Face: Positioning face bones can be tricky if you are not an expert in bone editing and they are almost useless if you plan to make facial animation through shape keys. Consider removing face features from your character if they aren’t really needed. If you don’t need the face all the face bones can be deleted. All the face bones are on the first armature layer by default. You can select them by displaying only bone layer 1, selecting all of its content and then deleting the bones in Edit Mode to correctly remove the face.\\nIf you want to scale all the face bones at once, consider scaling the face\\nmaster bone in Pose Mode (see Pose Mode matching method). The face master bone\\nis placed in the same position of the head bone.

It is based around a\\nbuilding-block approach, where you build complete rigs out of smaller rig\\nparts (e.g. arms, legs, spines, fingers…). The rig parts are currently few in\\nnumber, but as more rig parts are added to Rigify it should become more and\\nmore capable of rigging a large variety of characters and creatures.\\nRigify also operates on the principle that once a rig is created, that rig\\nshould no longer need Rigify. This means you can always distribute rigs\\ncreated with Rigify to people who do not have it and the rigs will still\\nfunction completely.\\nIt is important to note that Rigify only automates the creation of the rig\\ncontrols and bones.

This is developed as the base for a new modular\\nRigify face rig. These are the main ideas of the system:\\nGeneric B-Bone Chain\\nOne core idea of the system is that most of the deformation should be\\nimplemented using a standard powerful B-Bone chain rig. These chains support\\nadvanced behavior by interacting with other rig components. This is in\\ncontrast to having multiple domain-specific rigs that each generate their own\\ndeform chains.\\nThe implementation provides two versions of the chain rig: skin.basic_chain\\nmerely attaches B-Bones to the controls with no automation added to the\\ncontrols themselves. The skin.stretchy_chain rig in addition interpolates\\nmotion of the end (and an optional middle) controls to the other controls of\\nthe chain.\\nAutomatic Control Merging',\n",

The skin.stretchy_chain rig in addition interpolates\\nmotion of the end (and an optional middle) controls to the other controls of\\nthe chain.\\nAutomatic Control Merging\\nThe deformation part of the system consists of chains of one or more B-Bones\\nconnecting control points (nodes). Whenever controls for two chains would\\ncompletely overlap, they are automatically merged.\\nFor each merged control, one of the chains is selected as the owner, based on\\nheuristic factors like parent depth from root, presence of `.T`/`.B` `.L`/`.R`\\nsymmetry markers, and even alphabetical order as the last resort. This can be\\noverridden by an explicit priority setting in cases when it guesses wrong.\\nThe owner and its parents determine additional automation that is placed on\\nthe control.

Perform each one\\nof these using global or local axes. Depending on the order in which you\\nperform these, you will end up with different final orientations.

So proper\\nrotation coordinate systems are needed.\\n## Euler Modes\\nThe axes system used for performing Euler rotations is the so called Euler\\ngimbal. A gimbal is a particular set of three axes. The special thing about\\nthis is that the axes have a hierarchical relationship between them: one of\\nthe axes is at the top of the hierarchy, and has one of the other two axes as\\nits immediate child; at the same time, this child axis is the parent of the\\nremaining axis, the one at the very bottom of the hierarchy.\\nWhich axis is on top, which one in the middle and which at the bottom, depends\\non the particular Euler gimbal: there are six types of them, as there are six\\npossible combinations: XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY and ZYX Euler rotation modes.\\nThese modes are named using the letters of the axes in order, starting from\\nthe axis at the bottom of the hierarchy, and finishing with the one on top.',\n",

In that case, it will\\nremain aligned with the axis on top of the hierarchy. In that moment we have\\njust lost one axis of rotation. This can cause discontinuous interpolations\\nwhen animating. This particular loss of axis is known as the “gimbal lock”.\\nHint\\nThe actual configuration of the gimbal axes can be seen in the 3D Viewport by\\nenabling the _Rotate_ object gizmo and setting it to _Gimbal_ (from the gizmos\\nbutton in the header).

So the transform actions (move,\\nrotate, scale, etc.) are very similar to the same ones in Object Mode (all\\navailable ones are regrouped in the Pose ‣ Transform submenu). However, there\\nare some important specifics:\\n* Bones’ relationships are crucial (see [Bone Parenting](../../bones/properties/relations.html#bpy-types-editbone-parent)).\\n* The “transform center” of a given bone (i.e. its default pivot point, when it is the only selected one) is _its root_. Note by the way that some pivot point options seem to not work properly. In fact, except for the _3D Cursor_ one, all others appear to always use the median point of the selection (and not e.g. the active bone’s root when _Active Object_ is selected, etc.).\\n## Basic Posing',\n",
       "  '## Basic Posing\\nAs previously noted, bones’ transformations are performed based on the _Rest\\nPosition_ of the armature, which is its state as defined in _Edit Mode_. This\\nmeans that in rest position, in _Pose Mode_ , each bone has a scale of 1.0,\\nand null rotation and position (as you can see it in the _Transform_ panel, in\\nthe 3D Viewport’s Sidebar).\\nAn example of a rotation locked to the local Y axis, with two bones selected.\\nNote that the two green lines materializing the axes are centered on the\\narmature’s center, and not each bone’s root…\\nMoreover, the local space for these actions is the bone’s own one (visible\\nwhen you enable the _Axes_ option of the _Armature_ panel). This is especially\\nimportant when using axis locking, for example, there is no specific “bone\\nroll” tool in _Pose Mode_ , as you can rotate around the bone’s main axis just\\nby locking on the local Y axis ``R` `Y` `Y``… This also works with several\\nbones selected; each one is locked to its own local axis!',\n",

And obviously, when you transform a bone in _Pose Mode_ , its\\nrelated objects or object’s shape is moved/deformed accordingly, in real-time.\\nUnfortunately, if you have a complex rig set-up and/or a heavy skin object,\\nthis might produce lag during interactive editing.

You can have more than two points in the curve and tweak the transitions with the handles in the curve view (`G` to move).\\n3. To verify that the driver behaves correctly, deselect the option to only show drivers for selected objects.

In armature Edit Mode, add a new bone extruded from Bone 1, in the position at which Bone 2 should have the shape key active. This type of bones usually follow a naming convention such as “TAR-” (target) or “COR-” (corrective).\\n2. In the Drivers tab, select the _Averaged Value_ of the rotational difference between the bone you are rotating and the target bone. A rotational difference is the minimum angle between two objects in World Space. It is therefore important that the bones have the same root, so that the only thing affecting the angle between the bones is the rotation of one of them. When the deformation bone (Bone 2) reaches the target rotation (TAR-Bone 2) the rotational difference will be 0°.',\n",

When something is “animated”, it changes over time. This\\ncurve is shown as something called an F-Curve. Basically what an F-Curve does\\nis an interpolation between two animated properties. In Blender, animating an\\nobject means changing one of its properties, such as the object’s location, or\\nits scale.\\nAs mentioned, Blender’s fundamental unit of time is the “frame”, which usually\\nlasts just a fraction of a second, depending on the _frame rate_ of the scene.\\nAs animation is composed of incremental changes spanning multiple frames,\\nusually these properties are **not** manually modified _frame-by-frame_ ,\\nbecause:\\n* It would take ages!',\n",
       "  'As animation is composed of incremental changes spanning multiple frames,\\nusually these properties are **not** manually modified _frame-by-frame_ ,\\nbecause:\\n* It would take ages!\\n* It would be very difficult to get smooth variations of the property (unless you compute mathematical functions and type a precise value for each frame, which would be crazy).\\nThis is why nearly all direct animation is done using _interpolation_.\\nThe idea is simple: you define a few Keyframes, which are multiple frames\\napart. Between these keyframes, the properties’ values are computed\\n(interpolated) by Blender and filled in. Thus, the animators’ workload is\\nsignificantly reduced.\\nExample of an interpolation.\\nFor example, if you have:\\n* A control point of value 0 at frame 0,\\n* another one of value 10 at frame 25,\\n* and you use linear interpolation, then, at frame 5 we get a value of 2.\\nThe same goes for all intermediate frames: with just two points, you get a',\n",

Obviously, if you would\\nlike the frame 15 to have a value of 9, you would have to add another control\\npoint (or keyframe)…\\n## Direction of Time\\nAlthough F-Curves are very similar to\\n[Bézier](../../../modeling/curves/structure.html#curve-bezier), there are some\\nimportant differences.\\nFor obvious reasons, a property represented by a curve cannot have more than\\n**one** value at a given time, hence:\\n* When you move a control point ahead of a control point that was previously ahead of the point that you are moving, the two control points switch their order in the edited curve, to avoid the curve going back in time.\\n* For the above reason, it is impossible to have a closed F-Curve.',\n",

That value is\\nmultiplied by 2 × pi (6.28) and converted to 1.0 by the Sine function, since\\n\\\\\\\\(sin(2 × pi/ 4) = sin(pi/ 2) = +1.0\\\\\\\\).\\nSince the sine function can put out values between (-1.0 to 1.0), the _Map\\nValue_ node scales that to 0.0 to 1.0 by taking the input (-1 to 1), adding 1\\n(making 0 to 2), and multiplying the result by one-half (thus scaling the\\noutput between 0 to 1). The default _Color Ramp_ converts those values to a\\ngray-scale. Thus, medium gray corresponds to a 0.0 output by the sine, black\\nto -1.0, and white to 1.0. As you can see, \\\\\\\\(sin(pi/ 2) = 1.0\\\\\\\\). Like having\\nyour own visual color calculator! Animating this node setup provides a smooth',\n",

Animating this node setup provides a smooth\\ncyclic sequence through the range of grays.\\nUse this function to vary, for example, the alpha channel of an image to\\nproduce a fading in/out effect. Alter the Z channel to move a scene in/out of\\nfocus. Alter a color channel value to make a color “pulse”.\\n### Brightening (Scaling) a Channel\\nScaling a channel example.\\nThis example has a _Math (Multiply)_ node increasing the luminance channel (Y)\\nof the image to make it brighter. Note that you should use a _Map Value node_\\nwith min() and max() enabled to clamp the output to valid values. With this\\napproach, you could use a logarithmic function to make a high dynamic range\\nimage.

For example, a car\\nwould only have scratches in a few places where they make sense, not in random\\nplaces all over its body.\\nBlender offers a number of projections (Box, Sphere…) that automatically apply\\na 2D image to a 3D object, but these tend to only work for simple meshes. For\\nmore complex ones, you need to create a UV map instead. This is a flat area\\nwhere each face of the 3D object is laid out on the 2D image, specifying which\\npart of the image it should be textured with. This gives you complete control\\nover the mapping process.\\nThe name “UV” refers to the axes of the map: U for horizontal, V for vertical.',\n",
       "  'part of the image it should be textured with. This gives you complete control\\nover the mapping process.\\nThe name “UV” refers to the axes of the map: U for horizontal, V for vertical.\\nThese letters were chosen to avoid confusion with “X” and “Y”, which refer to\\naxes in 3D space instead.\\n## UVs Explained\\nThe best analogy to understand UV mapping is cutting up a cardboard box. If\\nyou were to take a pair of scissors and cut along its edges, you would be able\\nto spread it out flat on a tabletop. As you are looking down at the table, we\\ncould say that U is the left-right direction, and V is the up-down direction.\\nAs a next step, you could put the spread-out box on top of a poster, cut the\\nposter to match its shape, glue the poster to the box, and finally reassemble\\nthe box. You now have a 3D box textured with a 2D image.\\nA UV map describes how the box is cut up, and how it’s laid out on the poster.\\nYou have complete freedom in how to do this: if you wanted to, you could cut',\n",

Notice\\nhow, even though the checkered squares in the 2D texture are all the same\\nsize, they get different sizes when applied to the 3D dome (they’re smaller at\\nthe base than at the top). This is because the faces in the UV map have\\ndifferent relative sizes than in 3D space, which is a result of the flattening\\nprocess.',\n",

Once the catalog is created you can double `LMB` on it’s name\\nCatalogs can also be saved in the _Source List_ region of the editor by\\nclicking the save icon found at the top of the tree view.\\n## Components of a Catalog\\nEach catalog consists of a _catalog path_ , a _UUID_ , and a _simple name_.\\nNormally you would only deal with the catalog path; the rest is for internal\\nBlender use and/or for emergency situations.\\n### Catalog Path\\nThe path of a catalog determines where in the catalog hierarchy the catalog is\\nshown.

This is what is stored in\\nthe asset, and what determines the “identity” of the catalog. As a result, a\\ncatalog can be renamed or moved around (i.e. you can change its path), and all\\nassets that are contained in it will move along with it.

Blender\\ndoesn’t have an exact counterpart to the concept of a scope, so such\\nprimitives are imported as Blender empties located at the origin. This is an\\nimperfect representation, because empty objects have a transform and `Scopes`\\ndo not, but this approach nonetheless helps preserve the structure of the\\nscene hierarchy.\\n### Animations\\nThe importer supports two types of animation:\\n* **Animating transforms** : If a USD primitive has time-varying transform data, a [Transform Cache](../../animation/constraints/transform/transform_cache.html) constraint will be added to the imported Blender object.',\n",

In 1995 this rewrite began and was\\ndestined to become the 3D software creation we all know as Blender.
